<h3 id="purpose">Purpose of this Document</h3>
  
This document provides common classification and definitions for tests for CSE software. These
definitions and classifications are largely consistent with accepted definitions in the broader software
engineering community (for example, as defined on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) and other online sources). The goal is to
define a minimal set of definitions and classifications to cover the types of testing performed in many
CSE projects. The goal is not to create an exhaustive list of all the types of testing that have ever been
defined (such as on the Wikipedia Software Testing page ).

In addition to defining these categories and tests, some of the consensus views of the broader (agile)
software engineering community are injected. These views help to motivate and contrast the different
types of tests and help to guide how they can be applied in an effective software development process.
