This year, July 20 will mark the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon
landing.<sup>[1],[2]</sup> Between 1958 and 1965, both Russian and American space
programs attempted a total of over 36 unmanned Moon missions.<sup>[3]</sup>
Of the 6 that succeeded, none were survivable soft landings. Just crashing into
the Moon proved exceedingly difficult. Developing a guidance, navigation, and
control (GNC) system for manned Apollo missions<sup>[4],[9]</sup> was an
enormous challenge. At its heart was a revolutionary new computer: the Apollo
Guidance Computer (AGC).<sup>[5],[6],[7]</sup>
