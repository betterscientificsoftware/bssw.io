Enter details here by replacing *italicized text* with actual event information and without adding or removing lines.  You are encouraged to look at some [published events](https://bssw.io/events) in order to get a feel for how the requested information will appear on the site.

* **What:** *Event Title, in title case*

The title should be concise (more complete information can be included in the Description, if necessary).  If your event is a call for papers, posters, or other contributions, put that at the beginning of the title (for example, *Call for Papers: My Little Workshop*) and provide the deadline date for submissions below.  Once the deadline has passed, you can submit a new event for the event itself (sometimes refered to as a "call for participation", but we discourage including that in the event title).

* **When:** *Date or date range in "month day, year" format*

In the published event, the date appears immediately below the **title**, as well as further down, along side the **location** and **organizers**.  The date information is also used to control the visibility of the event on the <https://bssw.io/events> page.  Anything entered in this field that is not regoznied as a date or date range is *ignored* and will not appear in the published event.

* **Where:** *Geographical location, geographical region, or "Online"*

Events may include, for example, surveys, where the target audience is focused on a geographical region, such as "United States" or "European Union".

* **Organizers:** *The organizers of the event (text only).  Optional*

* **Website:** *URL for event web site*

The URL will be linked under the text "Event Website", which appears in two places in the published event: immediately after the **summary** and immediately after the **description**.

* **Summary:** *1-2 sentences (no more) to draw in the reader*

In the published event, this will appear between the **title** and **date** and the **date**, **location**, and **organizers** block, which is above the **description**.  It is styled in a font that is in between the **title** and the **description** in size (which makes long **summary** text take up a lot of space, which generally looks bad).

* **Description:** *The remainder of this issue will be treated as the body of the event.*
