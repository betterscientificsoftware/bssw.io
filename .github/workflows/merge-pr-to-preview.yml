# NOTE: Above, we use the 'if' statement for looking for the 'preview' label
# and then only run the job if that label is found in the PR.  I tried using
# the setting {label_name: 'preview'} for the `devmasx/merge-branch` action
# above but it seemed to ignore it and try to merge the PR branch to 'preview'
# anyway.
