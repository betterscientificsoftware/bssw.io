# pull request. So if someone tries, we add a polite comment and close the PR.

# This is a variant of superbrothers/close-pull-request, which only does pull_request events,
# not pull_request_target events.  Ideally, the capabilities will some day be merged, since
# the *only* distinction is a test on the type of event!
