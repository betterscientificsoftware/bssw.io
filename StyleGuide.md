### Style Guide: Content for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Site

#### Background

The [betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) repository is for collaborative content development on general topics related to [developer productivity](Site/Categories/Topics/WhatIsProductivity.md) and [software sustainability](Site/Categories/Topics/WhatIsSustainability.md). Also see information on [How to Contribute](HowToContribute.md).

See details on [What to Contribute](WhatToContribute.md).  Please place your new file in one of the following folders on the site, according to the type of content you are creating:
- Articles
- Articles/Blog
- CuratedContent
- Events

Follow the guidelines below for naming resources and files.  Be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSSw front-end site.

#### Resource Name:
- Brief, essential words only, nothing extra
- For curated content: Follow name of content (e.g., title of book, article, event, site)
- Filename:  Same as resource name, adding the suffix ".md" to indicate a Markdown file
    - No spaces
    - Cap for first letter of each word
    - Abbreviations:
        - Apps = Applications
        - Cse = CSE = Computational Science and Engineering
        - Devpt = Development
        - Eng = Engineering
        - Hpc = HPC = High-Performance Computing
        - Perf = Performance
        - Sw = Software
        - etc.
     - Example filename: MyNewArticleTopic.md

#### Resource Deck:
- One-sentence resource description (limited length, appears in header area of frontend)

#### Resource Description:
- Concise paragraph explaining resource from the perspective of the CSE community
- Image file (e.g., logo, relevant diagram, science image) - optional (encouraged when this exists)

#### Contributor(s):
- Name(s) of contributor(s), hyperlinked to GitHub profile(s)

#### Metadata: Include metadata as formatted comments at the end of the file
- **Publish**: Publish on the BSSw front-end site?
- **Categories**: Specify 1 or more categories (primary display via BSSw website)
- **Topics**: Specify 1 or more topics (visible filters via BSSw website)
- **Tags**: Specify additional tags as keywords for searches (optional -- not currently used on front-end website)
- **Level**: Specify level of content
- **Aggregate**: Optional info for aggregating content to define a more complex resource

Each aspect of metadata is described below.

#### Publish: Publish on the BSSw front-end site?
- Publish: Yes
- Publish: No

Only files designated as 'Publish: Yes' will be published on the front-end BSSw site.  Work that has not been finalized or is not intended for the front-end site should be designated 'Publish: No'

#### Categories: Primary display via BSSw website interface
[BSSw curators may add/revise topics as needed over time.]
- Planning
- Development
- Performance
- Reliability
- Collaboration
- Skills

#### Topics: Visible filters via BSSw website interface
- All categories and also finer grain topics within categories
  [Topics: 4-7 per category: family of topics that make sense together. BSSw curators may add/revise topics as needed over time.]
- **Planning**
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Software interoperability
- **Development**
    - Documentation
    - Version control
    - Configuration and builds
    - Deployment
    - Issue tracking
    - Refactoring
    - Software engineering
    - Development tools
- **Performance**
    - High-performance computing (HPC)
    - Performance at leadership computing facilities (LCFs)
    - Performance portability
- **Reliability**
    - Testing
    - Continuous integration testing
    - Reproducibility
    - Debugging
- **Collaboration**
    - Licensing
    - Strategies for more effective teams
    - Funding sources and programs
    - Projects and organizations
    - Software publishing and citation
    - Discussion forums, Q&A sites
- **Skills**
    - Personal productivity and sustainability
    - Online learning

#### Tags: Optional additional keywords for searches
- currently not used on front-end website

#### Level: Specify level of detail and depth of content
- **Level 0**:  BSSw WhatIs document
- **Level 1**:  BSSw HowTo document (or equivalent level of detail)
- **Level 2**:  More detailed content, beginner or intermediate levels
- **Level 3**:  Advanced content

#### Prerequisites: Specify files for any assumed knowledge on the BSSw site (usually Level 0 and Level1 BSSw docs)
- Most prerequisites are specified automatically according to Topics. In this case, use:
   - Prerequisites: default
- Specify additional prerequisites only for information not already covered by Topics.
   - Prerequisites: filename1.md, filename2.md, etc.

#### Aggregate: Optional info for aggregating content to define a more complex resource
 - Aggregate: none
   - Note an aggregate resource

 - Aggregate: base
   - The "base" designation of an aggregate resource indicates that content and metadata will be included from subresource files, as specified in a bulletted list of subresources.  See the file [CuratedContent/ResourceTemplate.AggregateBase.md](CuratedContent/ResourceTemplate.AggregateBase.md) for an example "base" file that demonstrates how to specify subresources.

- Aggregate: subresource
  - The "subresource" specification indicates that the item will not be displayed as a separate resource on the front-end BSSw site.  We expect this to be the most common usage.  

- Aggregate: stand-alone and subresource
   - The "stand-alone and subresource" specification indicates that the item will be both (1) listed as a separate resource on the front-end site and (2) used as a subresource, as specified by an aggregate "base" resource.
