# Security Policy

The BSSw.io project does not host any actual software.
However, the project does host software related content.
And, of course, the project utilizes a number of software products (e.g. GitHub, GitHub Actions, web browsers, GH Pages, etc.).
Concievably, security issues arising in any of these products could impact the BSSw.io site itself or our community's ability to use to the site.
That said, its unlikely security issues discovered here would effect other projects.

## Supported Versions

The BSSw.io web site is updated with new content fairly regularly.
That said, it is not in any sense *versioned* except that what is currently *rendered* as the BSSw.io site is generally always the head of the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security related concern for BSSw.io must be reported, it should be reported through the project's GitHub [**Security tab**](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/security/advisories) using the [**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/security/advisories/new) button.
A member of the editorial team will try to respond promptly.
