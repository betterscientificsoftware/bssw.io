# Security Policy

The BSSw.io project does not host any actual software.
However, the project does host software related content.
And, of course, the project utilizes a number of software products (e.g. GitHub, GitHub Actions, web browsers, GH Pages, etc.).
Concievably, security issues arising in any of these products could impact the BSSw.io site itself our community's ability to contribute to the site.
That said, its unlikely security issues discovered here would effect any other projects.

## Supported Versions

The BSSw.io web site is updated with new content fairly regularly.
That said, it is not in any sense *versioned* except that what is currently *rendered* as the BSSw.io site is generally always the head of the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the need to report a security related concern for BSSw.io ever arises, it should be reported through the project's [GitHub security](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/security/advisories/new) **Report a vulnerability** button.
