# Checklist for review of content types

Before the document can go online, we need to have a checklist of the things that need to be reviewed in the document before we can push it out onto the website. This document is for figuring out what this checklist will look like.

This document may contain ideas (if any) based on the discussion in Issue [#391](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/issues/391) or PR [#392](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/pull/392).

Before we can develop review checklists for various types of content, we need to
have a clear idea of the types of content we expect to support.  Our original understanding of our content types was described in the [What to Contribute](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/91648f8f992639ad8a9f5467e00cf6dc1bec21a7/WhatToContribute.md) document. Lately, there is another PR/issue (PR [#373](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/pull/373), Issue [#361](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/issues/361)) in the works which attempts to revise the content types and their attributes. These proposed changes are listed in the [content types and their attributes](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/markcmiller86-content-types-doc/Site/ContentTypes.md) document. We will follow this new document for our checklist discussion.

## Common review criteria
Once the document is ready for review, there are some checks that will be common across all the content types. The following is a list of such common review criteria
- [x] Grammar and syntax
- [x] Hyperlinks and their validity
- [x] Title format (what is bold?, capitalized?)
- [x] Deck format
- [x] Logos/images formatting
- [x] Check if professional proof-reading required. If yes, initiate and follow-through the entire proecedure
- [x] Check if it conforms to .md requirements of bssw.io frontend website and not just github
- [x] Category list (what category will the resource fall under?)
- [x] Check is tags are set properly for displaying (these are usually at the bottom of the article)
- [x] Check the document against the preview site

## Content Types Criteria Checklist
Based on the type of content, additonal review criteria may come into picture.

### Event
- [x] Does it conform to event format?  (we havent yet figured out this format)
- [x] TBD


### Curated Content: can be of the following types
We have decided to introduce a table (Example: [Bitbucket](https://bssw.io/items/an-introduction-to-bitbucket/) shows table for a website, [Legacy-code](https://bssw.io/items/working-effectively-with-legacy-code/) shows for a book, [Case studies paper](https://bssw.io/items/software-development-practices-in-academia-a-case-study-comparison/) shows for a paper, [Intro to Licensing](https://bssw.io/items/an-introduction-to-software-licensing/) for tutorials, [WSSSPE](https://bssw.io/items/an-introduction-to-the-wssspe-organization/) for organization) at the start of the curated content document to give consistency and a brief picture of what the curated content contains. The content of the table will be different for each curated content type (do we describe the layout of the table for each curated content in this document?). We havent yet discussed if such a table is needed outside of curated content resources.
