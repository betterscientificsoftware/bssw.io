# BSSw Fellowship Pages

These files are used to populate the [Meet Our Fellows](https://bssw.io/pages/meet-our-fellows) page and for each Fellow's individual sub-page.

## Templates
Each Fellow and Honorable mention gets a file in this directory. Fellows have more information / fields that the honorable mentions. Honorable mentions list their title (position at their institution) whereas fellows get a tagline for their project.
