### Resource toolkit and outreach on scalable, reproducible software practices

BSSw Fellow Jasmine Buckley-Williams is developing an online resource toolkit designed to help the computational science and engineering (CSE) and high-performance computing (HPC) communities adopt and implement best practices in scientific software development. The toolkit will feature tutorials, online seminars, and guidelines covering effective HPC software use, reproducibility frameworks, and collaborative version control. By providing clear, practical resources, the project aims to improve the sustainability, performance, and reliability of scientific software across diverse research domains.

Scientific research increasingly depends on complex HPC systems, which require not only efficient code but also reproducible processes and collaborative development strategies. This project addresses these needs by curating and creating accessible materials—ranging from beginner-friendly Git and GitHub guides to reproducibility workflows using containerization tools such as Docker and Singularity. Interactive workshops, webinars, and online discussions will engage researchers and developers, fostering the adoption of scalable and repeatable software processes. The toolkit will be actively promoted through conferences, social media, and the BSSw community, with measurable impact tracked through participant feedback, engagement analytics, and observed improvements in software quality.

Jasmine is a Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst and Master’s candidate in Big Data Analytics, with a background in data manipulation and management in utilities enforcement. Her work bridges the gap between technical excellence and practical accessibility, ensuring that HPC best practices are not only understood but also effectively applied in real-world scientific computing environments.
