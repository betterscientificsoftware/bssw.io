**Short Bio:** Introducing agile scientific software development to underrepresented groups

**Long Bio:** 
### Teach approaches for agile scientific software development, with emphasis on outreach to underrepresented groups.
Damian will develop and teach agile scientific software development tutorials in settings that reach underrepresented groups.  The only prerequisites will be familiarity with a Linux shell and a text editor. A related, novel aspect of the tutorials will be the integration of a professional development activity using agile practices. 

Damian is a research engineer and member of the Advisory Board of [Sustainable Horizons Institute](http://shinstitute.org). He has extensive experience in software design and development for multiphysics modeling, including classical, quantum, and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and multiphase flow. Damian also is the founder and president of the [Sourcery Institute](http://www.sourceryinstitute.org).
