**Long Bio:**
### Improving accessibility of research data and software with scientific web applications in Jupyter notebooks

BSSw Fellow Nicole Brewer is working to make scientific software accessible and reproducible with scientific web applications. Web applications provide accessible ways to disseminate research, teach, engage stakeholders, and even update policy makers. Jupyter Notebooks can be used to easily adapt existing researcher code into web interfaces that hide underlying code from users. Jupyter makes an excellent platform for development because it can be easily understood, inherited, and maintained by researchers. Nicole will develop tutorials for developing web applications in Jupyter Notebooks. Then she will then compile various example applications into a “cookbook” that will provide a reader with recipes for various Jupyter-based web application capabilities.

Nicole Brewer is a graduate research assistant and PhD student at Arizona State University, where she studies the science of science from the perspective of complex systems. She currently serves on the steering committee for the United States Research Software Engineering Association, and she holds a B.S. in Mathematics with Computer Science from Purdue University. Previously, she was a research software engineer at Purdue, where she developed web applications for domain scientists who were interested in making their work accessible and reproducible.
