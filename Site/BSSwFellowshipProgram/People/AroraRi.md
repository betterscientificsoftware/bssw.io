**Short Bio:** Optimizing I/O for better performance

**Long Bio:**
### Optimizing I/O of scientific applications can be critical to simulation performance but is usually an afterthought in application development.
Ritu will create videos, articles/blogs, and examples/exercises to demonstrate how to optimize I/O in scientific applications including the area of AI/machine learning. Her materials will cover the following topics: (1) Optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications written in C, C++, Fortran, Python, and R; (2) optimally writing and reading checkpoints in serial and parallel applications written using C, C++, Fortran, Python, R, MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA; (3) optimizing I/O and checkpointing AI/machine learning models/applications; and (4) techniques for leveraging the features in the underlying hardware and filesystems (e.g., Lustre) for optimizing applicationsâ€™ I/O while being aware of portability issues. The videos will be posted on YouTube, sample code will be posted in a GitHub repository, and the blogs will be shared as LinkedIn articles and BSSw.io blogs.

Ritu is a faculty member in the Computer Science department at Wayne State University. She is also the founder of [Venra Tech Inc.](https://www.venratech.com/), a company that provides solutions for advanced computing, data management, visualization, AI, and IT infrastructure development. Prior to joining Wayne State University, Ritu led the Research computing portfolio at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). She specializes in designing high-productivity and scalable infrastructure for powering discoveries and has led the development of the software infrastructure for integrating and efficiently utilizing supercomputing, cloud computing, and volunteer computing resources. Her areas of expertise and interest include High Performance Computing (HPC), data-intensive computing, cloud computing, advanced software engineering, and health informatics. Prior to joining UTSA, Ritu worked at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, where she was appointed as a Research Scientist at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), and as Associated Faculty in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences. Ritu received her Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2010. She passionately promotes the use of technology for creating social impact, and actively engages in the causes for creating inclusive policies and communities.
