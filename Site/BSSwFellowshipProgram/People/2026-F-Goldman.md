### User Experience Design for RSEs

BSSw Fellow Mary Goldman will create a written User Experience Design (UX) resource for research software engineering (RSE) developers. UX is not widely practiced for scientific software due to several factors. RSEs typically have limited time and resources to do the long and involved UX methodologies that are recommended in industry. Additionally, UX for scientific software is different from UX in non-scientific software. For instance, researchers are a unique group of participants who tend to be motivated to participate in studies by a sense of contributing to the greater good rather than monetary incentives. These differences between UX for industry and UX for scientific software mean that most UX resources contain methodologies or recommendations that are not always applicable for RSEs. The resource developed as part of this fellowship will detail what UX is as well as catalogue common UX methodologies and how they can be applied to the research software development process. The resource will focus on methods that can be done with few resources, such as heuristic evaluation, and consider the nuances of the scientific community.

Mary has been working with scientific software at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute since 2010. She is passionate about User Experience Design and co-leads the US-RSE UX working group.
