**Short Bio:** Improving code quality through modern peer code review  

**Long Bio:** 
### Save time and frustration from tracking down bugs with peer code review.
BSSw Fellow Jeffrey Carver modernizes scientific software quality assurance by teaching contemporary peer code review in scientific software development. His tutorial includes a general introduction to code review, a more specific discussion of the unique nature of scientific code review, and an overview of available tool support. Tutorial attendees participate in hands-on exercises to practice code review. The tutorial concludes with a group discussion about best practices for performing scientific code review. Learn more about peer code review through his tutorial website (including slides): <a href="https://se4science.org/tutorials/ECP19/"> Contemporary Peer Code Review Practices</a>, from the 2019 Annual Meeting of the DOE Exascale Computing Project. 

Jeff is a professor of computer science at the University of Alabama. Contact Jeff if you are interested in hosting a tutorial and developing code review in your organization.

***Perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program:*** I wanted to be a BSSw Fellow because of the recognition such an honor gives me within the research software community. The BSSw organization provides visibility to an important segment of the population. The connections that I have formed and are continuing to form are valuable in advancing my work on contemporary peer code review and in identifying future directions.
