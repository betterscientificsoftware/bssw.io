### Software gardening almanac: Cultivating sustainable software development in the generative era

Scientific software developed through factory assembly approaches often overlooks the dynamic evolution of code and risks becoming obsolete abandonware, costing resources and hampering scientific replicability. BSSw Fellow Dave Bunten will develop the Software Gardening Almanac, an open-source handbook of applied guidance and tools for sustainable software development and maintenance. The almanac will offer guidance to developers on dynamic, sustainable software management. This content, publicly developed on GitHub, will cover detecting and addressing challenges throughout the software lifespan for a range of topics such as code decay and broken environments. Users will access the materials through a structured indexing system (e.g., “SGA-C001” as a specific code senescence index key).

Dave is a software developer in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. He has over a decade of experience in the field of software development, data engineering, and holds an M.Ed. in Educational Technology. Dave is passionate about software design, research data engineering, in-memory data flow, and scientific software.
