# BSSw Fellowship Program 

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software.  

## About Our Fellows Program

The main goal of the BSSw Fellowship program is to foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes.  We also anticipate accumulating a growing community of BSSw Fellowship alums who can serve as leaders, mentors, and consultants to increase the visibility of those involved in scientific software production and sustainability in the pursuit of scientific discovery.

**BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software.  We select at least three Fellows per year and honorable mentions as appropriate.  Each 2021 BSSw Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software.**  Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

BSSw Fellows receive funds through their respective institution for one year.  We encourage BSSw Fellows to continue to serve the scientific software community as alums by helping select future classes of Fellows and providing leadership in their communities.
