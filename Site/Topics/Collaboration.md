# Better Collaboration

**Homepage:** Ways to facilitate and distribute work across teams, promote partnerships via software, and contribute to stronger communities.

**Overview:** 
Improving ways to facilitate work across teams and to promote partnerships and community contributions via software. We consider projects of all sizes, from small teams through multi-institutional aggregate teams.  

**Child Topics:**

- **Projects and Organizations**
Projects and organizations having a particular emphasis on scientific software development, productivity, and sustainability.
<!---Topic order: 1--->

- **Strategies for More Effective Teams**
Approaches for building teams and improving cohesion---working with small, large, and distributed teams---as well as practices for fostering a culture of inclusion and creating safe spaces, even if virtual, in which teams operate.
<!---Topic order: 2--->

- **Inclusivity**
Inclusivity, inclusion and inclusive practices and principles in scientific software projects which may or may not be as a part of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I).
<!---Topic order: 3--->
