- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**
The practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could achieve with a typical desktop computer or workstation in order to solve large problems, often in science and engineering.
<!---Topic order: 1--->

- **Performance at Leadership Computing Facilities**
Factors that must be considered when developing software for the leadership-class supercomputers, among the fastest computers in the world.
<!---Topic order: 2--->

- **Performance Portability**
Software exhibiting similar performance across multiple platforms, with the time to solution reflecting efficient utilization of computational resources on each platform. Resources address porting code to new architectures.
