# Better Planning

**Homepage:** Strategies for planning in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  

**Overview:** 
Improving strategies for planning in order to increase software productivity, quality, and sustainability, while underscoring the unique characteristics of scientific software, including that requirements often change during discovery.

**Child Topics:**

<!--
Addition: Software Engineering [moves from Better Development], Requirements, Design, Software Interoperability
-->
- **Software Engineering**
Procedures and considerations for developing well-engineered, reliable and maintainable software.
<!---Topic order: 1--->

- **Requirements**
Statements about what functions a software product shall perform, including any constraints under which it shall operate but avoiding as much as possible entanglements in how it shall be implemented.
<!---Topic order: 2--->

- **Design**
Major considerations in designing software to meet its scientific objectives and sustainability goals. Because requirements for scientific software often change during scientific discovery, design tends to evolve over time.
<!---Topic order: 3--->

- **Software Interoperability**
The ability of two or more software elements to be used together in an application, without special effort on the part of the user.  Levels of interoperability range from side-by-side usage through various types of interactions between packages.
