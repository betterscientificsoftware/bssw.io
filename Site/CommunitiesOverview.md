# Communities Overview

The Better Scientific Software umbrella encompasses a rich variety of communities who are working to advance the methods, practices, and processes of CSE software.  

**Community-specific landing pages**, tailored to unique perspectives and priorities, provide a variety of starting points for using the BSSw site and promote a shared understanding of CSE software issues.  Goals are to fully realize the role of CSE software as a cornerstone of long-term collaboration and scientific discoveryâ€”and in turn to help build stronger communities that increase leverage, recognition, and impact.
