# Environmental System Science Community

Flexible mechanistic modeling and simulation are critical for addressing important environmental questions.

The Environmental System Science Community considers questions such as the prediction of water availability and quality from watersheds under prolonged drought and warming temperatures. Integrated multidisciplinary projects in the DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) are developing mechanistic process-rich models of nutrient and carbon cycling and are collecting field and laboratory data to help inform and constrain these models.  

## Software challenges for environmental system science
These science questions raise a number of software challenges.  First, legacy codes contain significant mechanistic modeling capabilities but need to be refactored to componentize these capabilities so that they may be shared between codes and coupled to describe more complex systems. Second, most codes do not have comprehensive automated tests that enable refactoring of the design with confidence.  Third, most existing multiphysics frameworks have limited flexibility and extensibility, since they are based on the a priori static enumeration of a small number of coupling scenarios.  In contrast, models of terrestrial ecosystems are increasingly process-rich, and investigations include the iterative addition and removal of processes from the model.  Thus, runtime-configurable multiphysics and multiscale frameworks, such as those based on dynamically created dependency graphs, are a critical challenge. To this end, interdisciplinary teams are exploring agile methodologies to support common interface designs, multiphysics frameworks, model-data integration workflows, and the componentization of legacy codes.
