# Exascale Computing Community

The exascale computing community is working toward unprecedented computational resources for next-generation science.

The international exascale computing community is developing a holistic computational capability, including hardware, system software, libraries, and applications, to deliver and effectively use systems capable of at least one quintillion (10<sup>18</sup>) calculations per second.   In comparison, today’s fastest supercomputers operate in the petascale range (10<sup>15</sup> calculations per second).  When paired with critical advances in CSE algorithms and software, the unprecedented power of extreme-scale architectures will enable high-fidelity, multiscale, multiphysics modeling, simulation, and analysis—leading to accelerated, broadly impactful scientific discoveries.

## Software challenges for extreme-scale science

The transition of applications to exploit massive on-node concurrency, the requirement to couple physics and scales, and the continued disruption in the underlying hardware, system software, and programming environments together create the most challenging environment for developing CSE applications in at least two decades.  Software is escalating in complexity, as a result of increases in system scale and heterogeneity and demand for fundamental algorithm and software refactoring, in turn raising daunting issues in deploying, coordinating, extending, maintaining, and effectively using libraries, frameworks, tools, and application-specific infrastructure.  Moreover, as scientific applications increase in sophistication, interdisciplinary collaboration using software developed by independent groups becomes essential.  This situation brings with it a unique opportunity—and an implicit mandate—to fundamentally change how scientific software is designed, developed, and sustained.
