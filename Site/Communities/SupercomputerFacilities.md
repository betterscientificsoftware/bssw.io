# The Community of Supercomputer Facilities and their Users

The majority of computational scientists and engineers access high-performance computing resources through one or more centralized supercomputing facilities, which serve many users.

Supercomputers are large, expensive devices requiring significant infrastructure and support staff to operated effectively.  As such, they are often purchased and operated as centralized facilities with size and scope typically related to their funding sources.  This may range from departmental-scale to institutional, state or regional, and national or international. 

Facilities and their systems are often categorized as either *capacity* or *capability* systems, depending on the nature of the computing load and users they are designed to serve.  Capability, or *leadership-class* systems are the largest scale of system, which provide levels of computational capability not available elsewhere, and support users requiring that level of capability for individual jobs that due to size or time-to-solution requirements cannot be run on lesser systems.  Capacity systems are designed to support a broader base of users and problems, where computational requirements warrant the use of HPC systems, but individual jobs do not reach the scale of dominating a lerge HPC system.

Access to supercomputer facilities is handled in different ways. Many facilities face greater demands for computing resources than the have available, and use proposal-based mechanisms to help prioritize requests, though the rigor of the review may vary.  In many cases, allocations are made only to members of the sponsoring organization, though there are some facilities or allocation programs are open to a broader community.

Facilities often host users with a broad range of experience and sophistication in CSE and HPC.  Many facilities offer training opportunities aimed at helping users (and prospective users) improved their skills and knowledge, thereby making more effective use of the resources of the facility.  Some facilities have staff dedicated to providing various levels of support and assistance to users, with the same goal.

There are a vast number of supercomputing facilities aruond the world, and it is impossible to list them all, but some of those BWWs contributors are associated with include:

### Software challenges for supercomputer facilities and their users

Users bring many software challenges to the facilities where they carry out their computing.  However there are a number of particular challenges from the facility's perspective.  First of all, facilities field specific supercomputers.  They have an interest in seeing their users get the best possible performance out of their particular systems while recognizing that most of their users really want software solutioms that work well across the multiple facilities where they may do their computing.  As such, performance portability takes on a high profile.  Another particular challenge arises when facility staff are working with users to track down bugs or improve performance.  It is best for everyone, facility staff and users alike, when such issues can be quickly isolated and addressed, but not all users' software is easy to understand and work with.  Improvements in the quality (and existence) of documentation, software quality, and testing can greatly simplify and reduce the time required to find and fix bugs and performance issues.
