# BSSw Blog

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) project welcomes insightful and informative articles from community members on a variety of topics.

Developer productivity and software sustainability efforts for computational science benefit from communicating the experiences and reasoned insights from a broad spectrum of community members.  BSSw welcomes contributed articles in the form of blogs of 250 - 500 words.  We will solicit contributions from thought leaders in the community and welcome proposals from anyone. Please following the contribution policies referenced in the [BSSw README file](../README.md).
