# Better Planning

**Description:**  Strategies for planning in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  

**Overview:** While the CSE community is concerned with software quality and sustainability, the process of software planning is often ad hoc and incomplete, largely due to the unique characteristics of scientific software, which are not well aligned with mainstream software planning guidelines.  We provide resources to help teams with planning, while acknowledging that software requirements often change during scientific discovery.  

**Topics:**

- **Requirements:**
Statements about what functions a software product shall perform, including any constraints under which it shall operate but avoiding as much as possible entanglements in how it shall be implemented.

- **Design:**
Major considerations in designing software to meet its scientific objectives and sustainability goals. Because requirements for scientific software often change during scientific discovery, design tends to evolve over time.

- **Software Interoperability:**
The ability of two or more software elements to be used together in an application, without special effort on the part of the user.  Levels of interoperability range from side-by-side usage through various types of interactions between packages.
