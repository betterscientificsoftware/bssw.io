# Better Planning

**Description:**  Strategies for planning in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  

**Overview:** While the CSE community is concerned with software quality and sustainability, the process of software planning is often ad hoc and incomplete, largely due to the unique characteristics of scientific software, which are not well aligned with mainstream software planning guidelines.  We provide resources to help teams with planning, while acknowledging that software requirements often change during scientific discovery.

- **Software Deployment:**
Giving users the ability to use software on supported platforms. This will consist of releasing the software, for example in a traditional versioned (e.x. version X.Y.Z) way, or through continuous release. Deployment may also including installing the software for users in some situations.
