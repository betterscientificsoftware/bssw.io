# Better Collaboration

**Description:**  Ways to facilitate and distribute work across teams, promote partnerships via software, and contribute to stronger communities.

**Overview:** Software is the key crosscutting technology that sustains long-term CSE collaboration, encapsulating advances in applied mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering for use by others.  We provide information for CSE projects of all sizes, ranging from small teams (for example, a professor and collaborating students) to broad partnerships that span different scientific, institutional, and geographic areas.

- **Licensing:**
A legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.  **TO DO: Shorten this: Copyright and patents are two of the primary legal frameworks used around the world to govern the intellectual property rights associated with software.  Patents are related to the novel ideas embodied in the software, while copyright is associated with the expression of the code itself.  License agreements provide a means for the owners of the intellectual property rights to selectively grant rights to others, such as the use or redistribution of the software.**
