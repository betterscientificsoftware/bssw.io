# Better Reliability

**Description:**  Methods for testing and verification to ensure that software is robust and produces reliable results.

**Overview:** Good software reliability helps to ensure the integrity of CSE research for predictive simulations and decision support.  Moreover, because software encapsulates complex functionality for use by others, the reliability of CSE software is essential for collaborations that involve the combined use of software developed by independent groups.  

**Topics:**

- **Debugging:**
The process of finding and fixing defects in software. **TO DO: Shorten this:  Debugging involves the creative application of a variety of strategies and/or tools to diagnose the cause of a defective software behavior, to develop and implement a correction and finally to confirm, typically through [_regression testing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing), the correction fixes the defect without introducing more defects.**

- **Continuous integration testing:**
Code changes are merged and tested with high frequency. **TO DO: Shorten this: Taken to its extreme, one can think of continuous integration (CI) testing like auto-correct in a word processor where tests would be performed with each key-stroke entered by a programmer. Of course, that is neither practical nor likely to be too meaningful. However CI testing does mean that code changes, even on multiple branches of development, are merged and tested very frequently.**
