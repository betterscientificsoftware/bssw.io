# Better Performance

**Description:**  Approaches for developing code that is efficient, scalable, and portableâ€”from laptops to emerging extreme-scale architectures.

**Overview:** Achieving good performance of CSE code requires attention to both efficiency (use of appropriate algorithms and data structures for target problems and architectures, impacting the speed of runtime execution) and scalability (as computing resources increase, solving a fixed-sized problem faster and/or handling larger problem sizes).  However, focus on performance can have detrimental effects on other software quality metrics such as correctness, portability, and usability.  We provide information to help to improve performance while considering software design, practices, and processes that enable the preservation of other quality metrics.
