# Better Development

**Description:**  Aspects of scientific software development that should be systematically addressed in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.

**Overview:** Software development is a process of writing, maintaining, and extending source code to create software products. In a broad sense, software development includes all that is involved between the conception of the software through to the final manifestation of the software. 

**Topics:**

- **Documentation:**
Written text or illustration that accompanies computer software to explain how it operates or how to use it.

- **Version control:**
Management of changes to files.  Also known as revision control, source control, or source management.

- **Configuration and builds:**
Installing scientific software from source requires a system for setting up (configuring) software to compile and link (build) the code according to the user's specific platform and needs.

- **Software Distribution:**
Making software available to users and related activities. This could involve providing users with an installer, deploying the software on systems where the users can access it, or a combination of both.

- **Legacy code:**
Source code in which investments, tangible and in-tangible, are so great that wholesale re-write to *optimally* utilize newer computing technology is deemed too costly and/or too risky.

- **Issue tracking:**
The process of managing a collection of issues (bugs, feature requests, missing documentation, etc.) that are currently being handled, or should be handled, by a software development team.

- **Refactoring:**
The process of improving *internal* attributes of a software product (e.g. readability, maintainability) without modifying any of its existing external functionality.

- **Software engineering:**
Procedures and considerations for getting a well engineered, reliable and maintained software.

- **Development tools:**
Tools that support different aspects of software development, such as editors, integrated development environments, performance measurement and analysis tools, memory checkers, and debuggers.
