### What is Testing?

Testing is the process of assuring that a software product is meeting it requirements.

Testing addresses these basic questions:
##### Is the software written correctly, with no faults? (Verification testing)
##### Is the software solving the right problem? (Validation testing)

Tests typically come in the form of additional software that executes the software product, exercising it with known inputs that should produce expected output. Further testing concepts include:

#### Regression testing:
Executing a collection of tests that can detect if changes to the product have introduced a regression (failure).

#### Unit testing:
Fine-grain testing of individual funtions for correct behavior.

#### Functional testing:
Testing of the software across of set of functions as a proxy for how a user would use the product.
