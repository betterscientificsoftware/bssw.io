### What Are Strategies for More Effective Teams?

Research in CSE is inherently collaborative, bringing together people whose combined skills span across mathematics, computer science, and domain areas of science and engineering.  Perhaps most prevalent are small teams (for example, a professor and collaborating students and postdocs, or a modest sized research group).  Increasingly prevalent as CSE teams work toward next-generation challenges in predictive science are _aggregate teams_, composed of multiple successful previously existing teams, where software is a primary means of collaboration. Sometimes an aggregate team is known as a _team of teams_.   We provide information to help foster teamwork in teams of all sizes, leveraging people's diverse skills in pursuit of a common goal.
