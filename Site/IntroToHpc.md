# Intro to HPC

High-performance computers are significantly more powerful than their general-purpose counterparts, and are used to tackle particularly challenging computational problems in science and engineering, as well as other areas.

The initialism *HPC* can refer to either high-performance *computers* (the systems themselves) or high-performance *computing* (the *use* of high-performance computers).  It is usually clear from the context which is meant.

As computers began to become generally available as commercial products, the community began to realize that different workloads place different demands on the systems.  The idea of *high-performance computers*, or *supercomputers*, began to emerge in the 1960s as systems specially designed to address high-end computing needs, most often for technical, scientific, and engineering problems.  While there is no strict definition of a supercomputer, they are generally recognized as offering significantly higher performance than the general-purpose or *commodity* counterparts of the day, allowing them to handle computational problems that are too large for commodity computers or would take too long to solve.

The ways in which supercomptuers get their extra capability have varied over the years.  In earlier times, supercomputers tended to rely on custom processors that were typically faster than the general-purpose processors of the day, and the processors and other aspects of the system often included special architectural features not present in general-purpose computers, such as vector processors and solid-state disc drives. (Many unique features of supercomputers eventually work their way into commodity systems, as technologies improve and prices drop.) More recently, limits related to semiconductor physics, as well as economics, have dictated that most modern supercomputers be based primarily on commidity components with the extra computational capability coming from parallelism.  Today's supercomputers are typically comprised of tens to hundreds, or even many thousands of individual *nodes* integrated using a high-performance network.  Each individual node bears a resemblence to a personal computer or server.  

By way of example, the Cray XK7 system "[Titan](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/computing-resources/titan-cray-xk7/)" at the [Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) was the fastest computer system in the world when it went into service in 2012 (third fastest as of November 2016).  It is comprised of 18,688 nodes, each of which contains a 16-core server-class CPU as well as graphical processing uint (GPU) which is used to provide additional compute capability rather than graphics.  They are integrated by a proprietary network called Gemini, with a 3d torus topology.  The system has a peak performance in excess of 20 petaFLOPs (20 x 10<sup>15</sup> floating-point operations per second) and it occupies 4,352 ft<sup>2</sup> of floor space.  Titan itself contains no hard discs at all -- the storage system is separate, connected via a specially architected InfiniBand network. In 2012, it comprised 32 PB of storage, utilizing 20,160 2 TB hard drives and was capable of moving data to Titan with an aggregate read/write bandwidth of > 1 TB/s.

Due to this parallel architecture, modern supercomputers can be purchased at many scales, ranging from a small *cluster* that might serve a research group or a department to institutional systems to the largest *leadership-class* systems, which are resources at the national and international scale.  The [Top500 list](https://www.top500.org/) tracks the 500 most powerful supercomputers in world based on performance on the [LINPACK benchmark](https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/).  The list is updated twice a year. The largest systems in the world in 2017 provide performance in the tens of petaFLOPS.  PetaFLOP performance levels were first achieved in [2008](https://www.top500.org/lists/2008/06/).  The next major performance milestone in HPC is the [exaFLOP](Communities/ExascaleComputing.md), which is the subject of a great deal of work around the world on both hardware and software.  Current timelines have exascale computers becoming available in the early to middle 2020s.

### Why is HPC so Important?

HPC and [computational science and engineering (CSE)](IntroToCSE.md) are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship: HPC technology enables breakthroughs in CSE research, and leading-edge CSE applications are the main drivers for the evolution of supercomputer systems.  Advances in CSE typically come from some combination of being able to model larger physical systems, with greater resolution, for longer periods of time, and with greater fidelity to the actual physics.  These improvements are enabled by a combination of computer hardware and the software (and algorithms) that run on it.  Enabled by increasingly powerful supercomputers, computational modeling and simulation has become an increasingly imoprtant comoponent of modern science. HPC-enabled CSE is also playing an increasingly significantly role in industry.

### What are the Unique Aspects of HPC?

CSE software on high-performance computer must address a broad range of complexities.  A primary concern on modern HPC systems is parallelism, especially at the largest scales.  However the various architectures on the market, including heterogeneous processor types, hierarchical memories, and other distinctive features making it particularly challenging to express algorithms in a way that is portable across the variety of architectures.  The hardware-related challenges of programming HPC systems are exacerbated by the increasing complexity on the science side, with multiscale and multiphysics simulations, increasingly complex models, etc. The Better Scientific Software community is working to overcome challenges in CSE software complexity in both traditional HPC environments (clusters, networks of workstations, petascale machines) as well as [emerging extreme-scale architectures](Communities/ExascaleComputing.md).
