# BSSw Fellowship Program

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program gives recognition and opportunity to leaders and advocates of improved scientific software.  

### About Our Fellows Program

BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software.  We select three fellows per year.  Each fellow is awarded up to $10,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software.  Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

A BSSW Fellow receives funds for one year.  We encourage BSSw Fellows to continue to serve the scientific software community as alumni by helping select future classes of fellows and providing leadership in their communities.
