 ## Naming your content in Github repo
This section talks about how to name the ".md" file that is put in Github for ANY type of content/resource. Most points have been taken from the original [Styleguide.md](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/StyleGuide.md) file, present in the main betterscientificsoftware.github.io repo.

For naming a content i.e. creating a filename, please follow the following rules: Filename should be same as resource/content name, adding the suffix ".md" to indicate a Markdown file

- For curated content: Follow name of content (e.g., title of book, article, event, site)
- No spaces
- Cap for first letter of each word
- Abbreviations:
  - Apps = Applications
  - Cse = CSE = Computational Science and Engineering
  - Devpt = Development
  - Eng = Engineering
  - Hpc = HPC = High-Performance Computing
  - Perf = Performance
  - Sw = Software
  - etc.
- Example filename: MyNewArticleTopic.md
