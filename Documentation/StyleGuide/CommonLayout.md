## Common Layout of All Resources

All resources have the following sections, in common:

### Content Title
A Content title should be simple and straighforward. Please read *Styling Rules* for individual types of content (below) to see if there are any specific guidelines for each content type.

### Content Deck
A Content deck is a one or two sentence resource description of limited length and which appears in header area of articles on the frontend bssw.io site. Please read *Styling Rules* for individual types of content (below) to see if there are any specific guidelines for each content type.

### Content Description
This is the main body, explaining the content from the perspective of the CSE community. There may be image file (e.g., logo, relevant diagram, science image) in the body text, although these are optional (but encouraged when this exists). Please read *Styling Rules* for individual types of content described later in the article.

### Contributor name
This is name of the contributor, usually at the end of the resource text, with a hyperlink (usually to a GitHub profile(s)) if available. For ex: Contributed by [Foo Foo](http://github.com/Foo "Foo Foo")

### Metadata
We include metadata as formatted comments at the end of the file. Metadata helps define rules about publishing an article, tagging them, selecting categories etc. Be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSSw front-end site. Please read the the section on Meta-data to get detailed insight on the different tags and their importance.
