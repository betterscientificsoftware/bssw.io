## Common Layout of All Resources

All BSSw.io resources have the following three sections, in common: (1) Deck, (2) Main body, and (3) Metadata. 


The following image shows the deck and main body of a resource. ![Common Parts of a BSSw.io resource](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images/blob/master/documentation-common-elements-small.jpg)

Following is a description of the common elements.

### Deck
The deck is the top shaded portion of the article. The elements of the deck are mostly the same across all the BSSw.io content types but with a few variations. The deck section will always contain the title of the article, author/contributor/organizer names, publication date, BSSw.io categories and topics that the article falls under. In the context of blogs, it will usually contain an image and for curated content, it contains a two-sentence descriptive text about the curated resource.

Some of the common elements in the deck area are as follows:

#### Content Title
A Content title should be simple and straighforward. Please read *Styling Rules* for individual types of content in this guide to see if there are any specific guidelines for each content type.

#### Content Publication date
The date when the content was published. In the source file, please use the following format: *#### Publication date: Month Day, Year*. 

#### Contributor Name
This is name of the contributor/author/organizer, which contains the name of the contributor and a URL, usually to the github profile, of the contributor. In the source file, please use the following format: *#### Contributed by [Firstname Lastname](github profile url "Firstname Lastname")

#### BSSw Categories
The indicates which BSSw.io categories the article belongs to. As of April 2020, BSSw.io has six categories: (1) better planning, (2) better development, (3) better performance, (4) better reliability, (5) better collaboration, and (6) better skills. The most up-to-date categories can be obtained from the BSSw.io website (click Resources link at https://bssw.io/). In the source file, the categories for the article can be indicated in the metadata portion of the article. 

#### BSSw Topics
The indicates which BSSw.io topic areas the article belongs to. Each of the six categories on BSSw.io has several topic areas.  The most up-to-date topic areas can be obtained from the BSSw.io website (click Resources link at https://bssw.io/  to see the categories; and the topics are listed under each of the categories). In the source file, the topic areas for the article can be indicated in the metadata portion of the article. 

### Main body
The main body is the portion of the article below the deck.  The elements of the main body differ based on content type. 
The main body should explain the content from the perspective of the CSE community. There may be image file (e.g., logo, relevant diagram, science image) in the body text, although these are optional (but encouraged when this exists). Please read *Styling Rules* for individual types of content described later in this guide.

### Metadata
We include metadata as formatted comments at the end of the file. Metadata helps define rules about publishing an article, tagging them, selecting categories etc. Be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSSw front-end site. Please read the the section on Metadata to get detailed insight on the different tags and their importance.
