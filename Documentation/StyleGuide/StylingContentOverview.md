### Overview of Content Styling 

There are three types of content on BSSw.io: (1) Original article,
(2) Curated content and (3) Event-related content. Each content
type has its own style and presentation. 

There are common style elements to each content, as discussed in
the [Common layout description](CommonLayout.md) of this guide. The
style specific to each content is described in more detail in the
individual sections for that content, as shown below.
