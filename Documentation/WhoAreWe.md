#### Who We Are

**Better Scientific Software** is an organization dedicated to [improving developer productivity](Site/Categories/Topics/WhatIsProductivity.md) and [improving software sustainability](Site/Categories/Topics/WhatIsSustainability.md) for computational science and engineering (CSE).

This repository provides source material for the Better Scientific Software [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io) web portal. Better Scientific Software (BSSw) community members can contribute content using standard GitHub tools and processes. Contributions can be made via:
* **Web browser editing**:  For many people (even BSSw project members), this is probably the preferred way.  GitHub provides a nice web editor for Markdown.
* **Cloning**: If you have push access, you can clone and commit to this repository.  This approach could be best for remote editing and activities that span across multiple source files.
* **Forking**: This option is like cloning, but works for anyone.  You can make edits to your own forked copy of the repo, either in a browser or from a local repository.  Contributions are submitted to BSSw by using a pull request.
* **Submit article via Google Form**: For those unfamiliar with GitHub tools and processes, or who simply want to make a quick contribution, we offer a Google Form for submissions.
