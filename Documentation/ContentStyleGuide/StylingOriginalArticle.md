# Styling for Original Articles

An original article can highlight the following 2 types of resources: **(1) Blogs, (2) Short article.**

The main part of the original article consists of the (1) Deck, (2) Main body of the article and (3) Metadata. The following sections describe the structure and various parts of such an article. An original article must follow the below style guidelines. There are several examples available in the [betterscientificsoftware.github.io repository](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) to use as a starting point.


## DECK
As we know, all BSSw.io resources have decks and the deck has two parts: (1) deck text and (2) deck attributes. Following is guidance for "original articles" and their decks.

### Deck text/image
Original articles may have deck text or deck images. Deck text is usually a couple of lines about the event. Deck images creation is out-sourced by the BSSw.io team (for now). They are however added to articles, only after approval has been obtained from the authors.
 * Blogs *usually* have deck images and no deck text. 
 * Short articles *usually* have deck text. 
 * For guidance on the deck text, please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

### Deck Attributes

**Mandatory deck attributes (such as Deck title, Contributor name, Deck Publication date, BSSw Categories, BSSw Topics)** are part of deck for all BSSw.io content. Please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide for the mandatory deck attributes. There are no special deck attributes for this content type.

## MAIN BODY

### General guidelines
* BSSw.io team encourages authors to point to a modest number of additional resources that enhance your article. Too many links tend to distract readers.  In most cases, BSSw.io team would like to have the items authors refer to in BSSw.  These would usually be what BSSw.io calls "curated content", which means short items that provide a pointer to an extenral resource with a short description.  Authors are welcome to prepare those as separate contributions, and BSSw.io team is happy to help.

### Structure of the article
The structure of the main body has two parts: (1) Content of the Article; and (2) Author bios. 

#### Content of the article
The content of the article is free-flowing.

##### LENGTH
* General guidance is 250-500 words, though this is flexible (some articles have been shorter, some a bit longer). 

##### SOURCE FORMAT
* BSSw.io uses [Github-Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for original article markup.  However the team works with authors to accept other formats.
	
##### FORMATTING TIPS (DAVID CHECK)
 * The formatting to include a hero image is a bit finicky.
   - The `**Hero Image:**` tag must be followed by a blank line
   - The image itself must be in a Markdown list item (that is, it starts with `-`)
 * Positioning of the hero image relative to the contributor and publication date metadata doesn't matter
 * Having a deck and having a hero image in a blog post are mutually exclusive
   - A way to approximate having both is to have the hero image and then put the deck as your first (short) paragraph after the image and italicize it.
 * `#### Publication date:` is case sensitive (`d` in particular)

##### EMPLOYER APPROVAL
* If your employer requires an internal review and approval process prior to publication, please let us know.

##### REFERENCES
*  All reference links across all content types are handled in the same way; hence please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

##### IMAGES
* All images across all content types are handled in the same way; hence please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

#### Author Bios
This section has details of the author in a short paragraph. The content is free flowing.

## METADATA SECTION
There is no specific guidance for this for the event content type. See [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

## LINKS TO EXAMPLES IN BSSW.IO GITHUB FOR ORIGINAL CONTENT TYPE
