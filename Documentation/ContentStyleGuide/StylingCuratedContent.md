## Styling for Curated Content

A Curated content is a brief article that highlights other web-based content/resources. The written article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content. A Curated content article can highlight the following 7 types of resources: (1) book, (2) organization, (3) publication, (4) tutorial, (5) web article, (6) webinar and (7) website.

The following figure shows different parts of a curated content article.

![Parts of a curated content article](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images/blob/master/documentation-cc-example.jpg)

The main part of the curated article consists of the (1) Deck, (2) Main body of the article and (3) Metadata section. The following sections describe the structure and various parts of a curated content article.

A written curated content article must follow the below style guidelines. There are several examples available in the [betterscientificsoftware.github.io repository](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/tree/master/CuratedContent) to use as a starting point.

## DECK
As we know, all BSSw.io resources have decks and the deck has two parts: (1) deck text and (2) deck attributes. Following is guidance for *curated* content type and their decks.

### Deck text
Deck text is usually a couple of lines about the event. Most of these items are decribed in the [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide. The following guidlines are to be followed for the writing the deck text for *curated* content type.

1. No images are allowed in the deck.
2. If it is a publication, the deck text can start with "The *title of article* article, published in the *journal name* in alphabetic month, year, explores....". For ex: The *Best Practices for Scientific Computing* article, published in the *PLOS Biology journal* in Jan 2014, explores etc.


### Deck Attributes

The deck for curated content contains the title of the article, deck resource text, contributor names, publication date, BSSw.io categories and topics that the article falls under. 

**Mandatory deck attributes** that are part of deck for all BSSw.io content are listed below. Guidance, specific for "curated content" for these common mandatory deck attributes is given below. There are no *special deck attributes* for this content type.

1. **Deck Title**: In addition to guidelines from the [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide, please also note the following:
    * Maintaining consistency with titles across articles is good. For ex: "An Introduction to..." for organizations or website, if it makes sense.

2. **Contributor name**: In addition to guidelines from the [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide, please also note the following:
    * Please indicate the *name of the person* who is *writing* this content for inclusion on the BSSw site. In case of unresolved ambiguity, please use "BSSw.io team" as an author with no github url. 
    * *Example*: `#### Contributed by BSSw.io team`

3. **Deck Publication date**, **BSSw Categories**, **BSSw Topics**: There is no specific guidance for these for the event content type. See [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.
 

## MAIN BODY
### General Guidelines
1. Usually curated content do not need headings, but should you need one then the first level headings should start with `###` heading format.
2. Please write the body text in "third person".
3. If you do not plan to update the text in the future, refrain from adding text such as "TBD", "Coming soon". In such cases, please rephrase text to point to links where such information may be updated by the third-parties.
4. Whenever resource is mentioned in deck or body text in verbatim, it needs to be italicized
5. Its good for body text to go into details of why the resource is interesting and to what audience. 
6. This text should not be a copy-paste from a website. Rather, please write this in your own words to avoid legal issues

### Structure of the main body 
The usual sections of the body text for  curated content has two parts: (1) Resource table and (2) Description.

#### RESOURCE TABLE
Following the deck, is the main body of the article. The resource table is placed at the *start* of the main body of the article.

###### **SPECIAL TABLES**

###### Multiple resources of the same type

Many times, a curated article may mention multiple resources of the same type. An example of this is the curated content article, titled *[An Introduction to Documentation tools](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/CuratedContent/DocumentationTools.md)*, located in the curated content directory. In that case, use the following format for the table (below example assumes multiple websites in a single curated content article):

Resource information | Details 
:--- | :--- 
Resource name | Text that describes the overall websites. *Format: Brief 2-3 word text description*
Websites | Link to websites separated by commas, *Format : [website name1] (url1), [website name2] (url2)*
Focus | Custom focus area - this is a 3 word description of the focus area of the article, *Format: focus area1, focus area2.*

###### Multiple resources of the assorted type

Many times, a curated article may have a collection of various types of resources. In that case, it may be difficult to create a table at the very start of the article for these different types of entities. So, please create tables as and when needed throughout the article. An example of this is the curated content article, titled *[A Collection of Resources for Sustaining Open Source Software](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/CuratedContent/OSSSustainabilityResources.md)*, located in the curated content directory

#### DESCRIPTION

The description is usually two-three paragraphs of text. In the description on the article, usually towards the end, depending on the nature of the curated content, a logo and/or references to the article may be inserted. 

###### Logo declaration
Sometimes, curated content article may have logos. Logos are treated as images. All images across all content types are handled in the same way; hence please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

###### Links and References
All references across all content types are handled in the same way; hence please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

## METADATA SECTION
There is no specific guidance for this for the event content type. See [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.
