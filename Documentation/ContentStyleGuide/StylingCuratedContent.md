### Overview of Style for Curated Content

A Curated content is a brief article that highlights other web-based content/resources. The written article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content. A Curated content article can highlight the following 7 types of resources: (1) book, (2) organization, (3) publication, (4) tutorial, (5) web article, (6) webinar and (7) website.

The following figure shows different parts of a curated content article.

![Parts of a curated content article](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images/blob/master/documentation-cc-example.jpg)

The main part of the curated content article consists of the (1) Deck and (2) Body of the article. The following sections describe the structure and various parts of a curated content article.

A written curated content article must follow the below style guidelines. There are several examples available in the [betterscientificsoftware.github.io repository](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/tree/master/CuratedContent) to use as a starting point.

#### Deck Title declaration
1. While there are no strict rules for titles; maintaining consistency with titles across articles is good. For ex: "An Introduction to..." for organizations or website, if it makes sense.
2. The title of the article also becomes a portion of the article URL (as of Apr 2020); hence changing the title after publishing it is strictly discouraged.
3. Conjuctions and Prepositions, used in the title, should be lowercase. Every other word should be sentence-case.


#### Deck resource text
The deck for curated content contains the title of the article, deck resource text, contributor names, publication date, BSSw.io categories and topics that the article falls under. Most of these items are decribed in the [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide. From the styling perspective, the deck resource text is the most important. The following guidlines are to be followed for the deck resource text section.

1. No hyperlinks are allowed in the deck.
2. No images are allowed in the deck.
3. The deck contains one or atmost two sentences about the article which piques user interest.
4. Whenever resource is mentioned in deck or body text in verbatim, it needs to be italicized.
5. If it is a publication, it can start with "The *title of article* article, published in the *journal name* in *alphabetic month, year*, explores....". For ex: The *Best Practices for Scientific Computing* article, published in the *PLOS Biology journal* in *Jan 2014*, explores etc.
 
#### Resource Table declaration
Following the deck, is the main body of the article. The resource table is placed at the *start* of the main body of the article. The table ensures consistency across all the curated content articles. It highlights the important links in the article. Resources pointed by the curated content article can be of 7 types. The content of the table will be different for each resource type, as described below.

###### Special tables

###### *Mutliple resources of the same type*

Many times, a curated article may mention multiple resources of the same type. An example of this is the curated content article, titled *[An Introduction to Documentation tools](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/CuratedContent/DocumentationTools.md)*, located in the curated content directory. In that case, use the following format for the table (below example assumes multiple websites in a single curated content article):

Resource information | Details 
:--- | :--- 
Resource name | Text that describes the overall websites. *Format: Brief 2-3 word text description*
Websites | Link to websites separated by commas, *Format : [website name1] (url1), [website name2] (url2)*
Focus | Custom focus area - this is a 3 word description of the focus area of the article, *Format: focus area1, focus area2.*

###### *Mutliple resources of the assorted type*

Many times, a curated article may have a collection of various types of resources. In that case, it may be difficult to create a table at the very start of the article for these different types of entities. So, please create tables as and when needed throughout the article. An example of this is the curated content article, titled *[A Collection of Resources for Sustaining Open Source Software](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/CuratedContent/OSSSustainabilityResources.md)*, located in the curated content directory

#### Main Body text
1. Contains one or more paragraph about the resource.
2. Whenever resource is mentioned in deck or body text in verbatim, it needs to be italicized
3. Its good for body text to go into details of why the resource is interesting and to what audience. 
4. This text should not be a copy-paste from a website. Rather, please write this in your own words to avoid legal issues

#### Logo declaration
Sometimes, logos may be present at the end. This is especially relevant for organizations, websites etc.
1. Please upload logo to https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images.
2. Add following text with url to end of body text * < img src='url' class='logo' / > *
3. Please ensure we have permission to use the logo 
**This section needs to be reviewed**

#### References for the article
Many times, we may have references/citations at the end of the article. There is a certain process for this. Please contact the Editor-in-chief for more information on this. Details: To be described.
