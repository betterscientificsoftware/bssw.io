### Overview
Most CSE software needs to be installed from source on a wide variety of machines by end users. Developers of the software must decide how to enable this installation easily without overburdening the developers of software or the end users. This document introduces several approaches to use depending on the contents and scale of the software package.

### Target Audience
Scientific software project leaders and developers who need to ensure that their software can be installed on a wide variety of machines.

### Prerequisites
First read the document [What Is Software Configuration?](https://ideas-productivity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IDEAS-ConfigurationWhatIsSoftwareConfiguration-V0.2.pdf)

For simple packages that have almost no dependencies or machine dependent parameters, the use of (1)
an options file is acceptable. For packages that incrementally build on another package, it can be
reasonable to piggyback on the other package’s configuration information, thus requiring the end user
merely to edit a file to indicate the location of the piggybacked package.

For all other packages we recommend using the open-source tools (2) [GNU Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) or (3) [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or (4)
rolling your own configuration system that utilizes the syntax of the Autoconf command line arguments (see
comparison of features in the table below). GNU Autotools is widely used and has a great deal of support
resources on the web but is a bit idiosyncratic. Almost all Linux users and many Mac OS users are familiar
with and expect the Autotools command line syntax. CMake is a product of a for-profit company [Kitware](http://www.kitware.com/)
whose business model is based on paid customer support (CMake is open-source software and free
community support is available on the open CMake mail lists). CMake comes with a testing environment
CTest (which posts to a web dashboard CDash) and a packaging system CPack.

### Creating a GNU Autoconf configure script
The GNU open source package [Autotools](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) is distributed by GNU and is available for any modern system. In
brief, the software developer creates a “configure.in” file, which contains all options that can be set and any
tests that should be run, and writes makefile templates that will be populated with information from the given
options. Next, the developer runs Autoconf to generate a “configure” file, which will then be included as part
of the source distribution. Autotools also provides Automake, which helps with the generation of the
makefiles from a Makefile.am file, and Libtool, which helps to manage building libraries. The details on how
to make a usable “configure.in” file and makefile templates are beyond the scope of this document;
numerous books and online references can help with these tasks. For high-performance computing
machines that utilize a batch system – that is, require submitting all programs to a queue to be run on the
machine – GNU Autotools can be problematic since it relies on being able to automatically build and run
programs to determine machine properties.

###  Creating a CMake build

CMake has very different syntax from the GNU Autoconf configure scripts but performs essentially the same
function. Thus, it has analogous options and variables that must be communicated to the build system. As
an example, where configure may expect to set the C compiler by checking the passed in ‘CC’ variable,
CMake looks for the option ‘CMAKE_C_COMPILER’ first and if it does not find it, uses the compiler listed by
the environment variable ‘CC’.

A CMake project must define a CMakeLists.txt file in its distribution. This file is analogous to the configure.in
file for GNU Autoconf builds (and the Makefile.am used by Automake), in that it describes what options or
variables are expected from the software installer and how those options will be broadcast to the makefiles
that actually compile the software.

Unlike GNU Autotools, however, CMake provides facilities for use on high-performance computing machines
that utilize a batch system. Unfortunately, it relies on a database of machine properties, and this database is
often out of date for many high-performance computing sites. GNU Autotools and CMake both support
cross-compiling, which can be used on a batch-based system, but this disables the useful configure-time
testing that the tools provide.

### Rolling your own configure script

A “configure” script can also be written without using the GNU Autotools programs and not requiring the use
of M4 for those who want to avoid it <sup>[1]</sup>. This approach has the advantage of allowing additional features and behavior not provided by GNU. It is highly recommended that any other configure script follow the syntax  and expected behavior of a GNU Autoconf-generated script.

* Use the --help option to list and explain the various options available.
* Use --prefix= to denote where to install header files and binaries.
* Check the command line and the environment for compiler variables CC, CFLAGS, CXX,  CXXFLAGS, and other similar variables. If these are not specifically given, then make some  guesses based on what executables are available.

No matter how your configure script is created, users expect certain conventions.
* Use --with-xxx (and --without-xxx) for describing what is available in the install environment. For
example, if your build behaves differently if LAPACK is available or not, then you should use a
--with-lapack option<sup>[2]</sup>.
* Use --enable-xxx (and --disable-xxx) to turn on or off features in the code, such as options to build
fortran interfaces, debugging symbols, or shared libraries.
* Print out useful messages if there is a problem or inconsistency with the options.


### Comparison of Software Configuration Features
Feature | (1) Parameter file | (2) GNU Autotools | (3) CMake | (4) Roll your own configure|
--- | --- | --- | --- |---

Portable support for shared libraries | | Yes, but you need to also use libtool or gmake as well. | Yes | Yes, but you need to provide the knowledge and logic for every platform
Portable automatic generation of dependency information |  | Yes, but requires usage of automake and requires compiler support for generating dependency info, which they all have. | Yes, built into the CMake executable, not dependent on compiler support. | Yes, but you have to roll your own
Provides database for known HPC computer systems |  |  | Yes, though sometimes not available for new prototype systems. |
Includes graphical interface |  |  | Yes |









Regardless of the method used to configure, your system should do the following.
* Provide end users access to the options that were used to configure the file and also the internal
variables that were set when the “configure” script ran. This information is helpful for reconfiguring a
software package to prevent having to duplicate any trial-and-error learning process, and it can help
keep all dependencies consistent for future software builds.
* Make proper documentation available for the installer. At the least, any required software
dependencies should be listed, every configuration variable should be explained, and appropriate
examples should be given. This documentation can be on an installation instruction web page or
text file included in the distribution, and it should also be available from command line help queries.

### Common configuration options for scientific software

Many scientific software libraries and applications require the same information when configuring, such as
locations of BLAS and LAPACK. When a set of interacting software libraries is built, the same options must
be used for each of the libraries. In the past each software package selected its own name for these options,
making installing multiple packages painful and error prone. The IDEAS team has developed a set of
standard configuration options that we recommend you follow.




### Notes

<sup>[1]</sup> For example, PETSc’s configure, written completely in Python, provides all the functionality of GNU
Autotools as well as the ability to install other packages and work on batch computer systems.

<sup>[2]</sup> GNU recommends that you do not use locations with these variables but instead add any necessary flags
to the LDFLAGS environment variable (i.e., GNU prefers LDFLAGS=/usr/lib/libpack.a --with-lapack instead
of --with-lapack-dir=/usr/lib/liblapack.a). We disagree with this recommendation because the latter approach
allows tests to be written for each particular option.
