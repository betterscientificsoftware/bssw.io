As we enter 2023 and into the seventh year of BSSw.io, I want to thank the BSSw.io community for their continuous support in making BSSw.io a premier portal for sharing information on software sustainability, productivity and quality.  BSSw.io continues to feature a rapidly-expanding collection of resources from an international community of contributors who are sharing their perspectives on challenges, strategies, and best practices on these topics. We are thankful for the thoughtful articles and contributions that were made to the BSSw.io site this year. Increasing variety in articles prompted us to add several new topic areas focusing on peer code review, big data, cloud computing etc., which has led to a more enriched reader experience.   In this blog post, we list some of the interesting articles and blogs that have especially resonated with readers. Happy new year to our entire community!
