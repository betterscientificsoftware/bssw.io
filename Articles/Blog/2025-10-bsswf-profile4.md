The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship may only last a year, but it can have positive impacts that last a career. Just ask Robert Latham, a senior scientific programmer in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.

Robert Latham strives to help scientific applications use input/output (I/O) more efficiently. ​He wants to help others diagnose and debug I/O problems in performance and correctness in high-performance computing. Through his BSSw Fellowship, he developed a one-day course on how to investigate and fix potential problems that is available and accessible to a broader audience.

“I’m still using the benchmarks, scripts, and tools that I developed in that presentation,” says Latham. “Much of the work I did as a Fellow informed my subsequent presentations, and we often give it as [a tutorial](https://sc25.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=tut155&sess=sess270) at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC25).”

In addition, he and his colleagues will refer to his outline as they prepare for the annual [Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/) summer school. “The tutorial gives users an idea of where they should start to get the best performance,” says Latham. “It's an example of using tried-and-true tools in new environments.”

He credits the support of the BSSw Fellowship with having helped him hone his presentation. “At this point in my career, the nice thing about the fellowship is having dedicated time to produce a seminar, a working set, and a collection of examples,” says Latham. “We don't get a lot of time to do this type of work in our usual rush of proposals, deadlines, and deliverables.”

Latham notes that being part of the BSSw network and getting to know the BSSw Fellows and Honorable Mentions and their work are great ways to learn what is new in research software engineering. “I appreciate being able to understand the way that other people are thinking about the problems we're facing and how to solve them,” says Latham. “The BSSw Fellowship program has been so great that the only thing I would want would be more of it so we can see more of what is happening in the field.”
