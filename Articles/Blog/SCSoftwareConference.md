Recent conferences in the Supercomputing series have included a growing number
of events related to software development. Celebrate by participating in these
events. And let’s make sure there are even more next year!

### My Early Experiences at Supercomputing

I attended my first Supercomputing in 1993 as a postdoc in computational
chemistry. It was a celebration of high-end hardware, which was particularly
relevant to my work. But the technical program at that time didn’t hold so much
interest for me as a chemist. For a long time, I wasn’t motivated to return to
the annual conference.

By the year 2000, I’d changed jobs a couple of times, and I’d shifted my
research program to focus on computer science, including many issues around
software environments and software development – motivated in part by my
experiences in computational chemistry. I started attending Supercomputing
again. The conference was still a celebration of high-end hardware, but the
technical program had expanded — both broadening and deepening. And it started to
become more relevant to my personal research activities. I was part of a
multi-institutional project to develop component-based software development
approaches for high-performance scientific computing. We had offered tutorials for
many years; and once Supercomputing added workshops to its program, we brought to
Supercomputing
an international workshop series we’d started for this community. But apart from that, I didn’t see too many opportunities at a
typical Supercomputing to discuss the practice and experience of the development
computational science and engineering software for high-end computers.

### Supercomputing Today

Since 2000, I’ve attended every Supercomputing conference but one. And over
time, I’ve seen significant growth in the role that *software* plays in the
conference. Next week, SC18 will convene in Dallas, Texas, and the [roster of
software-related events](https://bssw.io/events/sc18-software-related-events) at
this year’s conference is extensive. There are workshops on
reproducibility and correctness, as well as on training and education in HPC –
particularly important since so little formal training is available in
software development practices for computational scientists and engineers. There are keynotes on software sustainability and development practices at two other workshops. There is a tutorial on producing better scientific software, and
a tutorial on Spack, a next-generation package management tool designed with the
special environment and needs of typical supercomputers in mind. And there’s a
panel discussion on sustaining research software. 

There are also a number of BOFs related to *software*. BOF stands for Birds of a Feather, and they are really just
opportunities to gather communities of interest for discussions in a format
defined by the organizers. But when you have 12,000+ people at a conference,
there's a lot to discuss! This year, there are BOFs for the Spack
community and the U.S. national research infrastructure for computing. But more
significant to me is the BOF on "Software Engineering and Reuse for Computational
Science and Engineering," which will be the fourth installment at Supercomputing,
and a spin-off BOF on Research Software Engineering, a name that is gaining
acceptance around the world for the community of people who invest their careers
in the development of research software. The acceptance and high levels
of participation we’ve seen in these events over the past couple of years are an
indication of the growing recognition of *software* as an important topic to the
Supercomputing community.

So if you think software development, productivity, and sustainability are
important issues (and if you’re reading this blog, chances are you do), then I
encourage you to join us at these events at SC18! Not only is your participation 
an opportunity for you to find like-minded people for discussion and exchanging experiences; it is also a statement to the organizers of Supercomputing that you value events on
*software,* which helps pave the way for even more of these events in the future.

And remember, the Supercomputing conference series is
fundamentally defined by what the community submits – not only papers and
posters, but also proposals for workshops, tutorials, BOFs, panels, and other
types of events. Submissions are competitive, so not every proposal will be accepted.
But with persistence, we have the opportunity to make SC into even more
of a software conference than it is already - to *create* a future where we can discuss
software development experiences on par with the scientific results and the big
iron on which they were obtained.

### Bringing More *Software* into More Conferences

But remember, too, that Supercomputing is not the only venue that provides
significant opportunities for the community to shape the meeting, beyond the
traditional paper and poster submissions. 

- **ISC High Performance**, the European counterpart to Supercomputing, offers many of the same types of events as SC and
has submission deadlines coming up in the November-February time frame
(depending on the type of event). 
- **SIAM conferences** are traditionally participatory, with opportunities to organize minisymposia and topical poster
sessions. You may have noticed previously on the [BSSw Events](https://bssw.io/events) page that events were listed for the **Computational Science and Engineering 2017 (CSE17)** and **Parallel Processing 2018 (PP18)** conferences, as well as a call for posters (now closed) for **CSE19**, coming this February. 
- The **Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC)** conference series also includes the opportunity to organize minisymposia, with submission deadlines in the December-January time frame. 

And many other conferences offer opportunities for companion tutorials and workshops. 

- The long-standing [Software Engineering for Science (SE4Science)](https://bssw.io/resources/software-engineering-for-science-se4science) workshop series has been associated with the **International Conference on Software Engineering** for many years, and in the past also with **Supercomputing**.
- The International Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE) series, for example, has colocated variously with **Supercomputing**, **SciPy**, **Gateway Community Environments**, the **RSE Conference**, and **eScience**.

Maybe in time, by working together, we can ensure that discussions about *software* are a prominent part of all of the technical conferences that we care about.

See you in Dallas!
