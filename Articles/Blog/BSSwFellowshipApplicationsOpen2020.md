Applications are now open for the 2021 BSSw Fellowship Program, which gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software.

Addressing scientific software challenges magnified by rapidly changing computing environments requires broad community collaboration to improve developer productivity and software sustainability—as key aspects of ensuring the integrity of computational results and increasing overall scientific productivity.  

The [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) provides recognition and funding for leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software who foster practices, processes, and tools to improve scientific software productivity and sustainability. BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software. We select at least three Fellows per year and honorable mentions as appropriate. Each 2021 BSSw Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software. Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

We encourage diverse applicants at all career stages—ranging from students through early-career, mid-career, and senior professionals—from throughout the computational science and enginnering (CSE) and software communities. We are looking for applications from people with the following characteristics:

* Passionate about scientific software.
* Interested in contributing powerful ideas, tools, methodologies, and more that improve the quality of scientific software.
* Able to use the fellowship to broadly benefit the scientific software community.

Applicants must be affiliated with a U.S.-based institution that is able to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Energy. Typically such institutions include U.S. government labs, U.S. universities, and U.S.-based corporations.
