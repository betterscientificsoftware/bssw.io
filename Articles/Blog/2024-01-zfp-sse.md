I happened to be exchanging emails with [Peter Lindstrom](https://github.com/lindstro) asking various questions about [zfp] software sustainability engineering (SSE) challenges.

For background, at its core [zfp] is a C library for lossy compression of multi-dimensional arrays of floating point data.
Over the course of ECP, the [zfp] project was pushed not only to add a number of operational features including C/C++ language-friendly array types, C/C++/Fortran/Python language bindings, OpenMP and CUDA parallelism and HDF5 integration but also to harden various of the SSE practices used in the development of [zfp].
This article focuses on the effort to harden the SSE practices of [zfp].

To stimulate some dialog, I asked Peter various questions.
Do you feel like LLNL/ECP did its part by providing funding and deploying technologies and it was left up to you and your team to learn to use and apply them?
Do you feel like ECP really supported you in your SSE quests on [zfp]?
If you had it to do all over again (I mean the SSE learning curve/ramp), how would you do it differently and/or what resources would have made it easier/faster?
Where do you think SSE practices on [zfp] compare with other similar projects you are aware of or familiar with?
Do you feel like your own personal investments in applying SSE practices in [zfp] was time well spent or do you feel like it took you too far astray of your core research objectives?

Below are Peter's thoughts inspired by these questions.

> I can absolutely say that [zfp] would not be anywhere near where it is without the *funding* ECP provided.
> This allowed me to hire developers/SEs to do the work to transform [zfp] from a research prototype to a production quality package.
> I kind of had to learn on the job; other than funding, I can't point to anything in particular that ECP provided to facilitate this learning process, though I am aware that ECP has also supported various training activities (of which I unfortunately did not have the opportunity take advantage of).
> Another thing ECP did was give us access to hardware vendor software engineers who helped with performance tuning.

> Working together with ECP AD and ST customers has also benefited [zfp] in terms of learning about features that would be useful and in terms of integrating [zfp] into other packages and applications.
> I found many ECP meetings to be productive because most of these interactions occurred at them.
LLNL provided additional support through [RADIUSS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/radiuss), particularly to develop the Python API.
> There has been other funding sources though primarily for basic or applied research on floating point data compression and not directly responsible for SSE on [zfp].

> I have certainly learned a lot of SSE over the last seven years that [zfp] has been funded by ECP.
> Because of that, I no longer consider myself only a researcher.
> On the other hand, I don't consider myself an expert software developer, either.
> I think I have found the right balance somewhere in the middle of R&D.
> I have at least made an attempt to adopt a number of best practices in software development.

> In some sense, I also feel that LLNL's change in stance from supporting only restrictive, custom licenses (circa 2015) to instead encouraging open source development under more permissive licenses has also helped a lot.
> I used to maintain [zfp] release assets in a somewhat adhoc fashion on the LLNL Computing department's web server.
> [Ian Lee](https://github.com/IanLee1521) took it upon himself to set up a GitHub repo for [zfp] (and other products), which really got the ball rolling on starting new SSE practices.

> To be honest, I don't think I would have benefited as much from taking formal training to learn the tools and practices I now use daily.
> I feel that I need to get my hands dirty and *do* in order to learn.
> But it was very helpful to work with and learn from someone (Markus Salasoo, a developer on [zfp] during the earlier part of ECP who had industry experience with SSE).
> I think I relied a bit too much on Markus in the beginning.
> It was only after he left the project that I really had to role up my own sleeves and get immersed in git/GitHub and learn how to use these and other tools.

> In this sense, I feel like learning on the job can be a good thing.
> On the other hand, I find that we (Danielle and I) sometimes spend a lot of time searching for answers to deal with oddball CI and software tool issues.
> It would be nice to have access to a help desk or hotline to get questions like these answered quickly from experts to cut down on time spent searching for answers.
> Sometimes Slack helps to get such questions answered, sometimes not.

**Editor's note:** My own experience with even the free version of ChatGPT is that it often helps me to find a key entry point into a large body of documentation on a topic I am not familiar with.
For example, I used it to help guide my adding OpenMP parallelism to the [hello-numerical-world](https://github.com/markcmiller86/hello-numerical-world/tree/main) example and it got me, an OpenMP novice at the time, up and running in less than an hour.
I think if I had had to read through documentation, it would have been more than 4 hours.
That said, the free version of ChatGPT doesn't know anything newer than ~2021.

> From a personal perspective, I remember feeling a bit overwhelmed having to learn ReadTheDocs, Sphinx, and RST to write [zfp] documentation from scratch in only a few weeks to meet an ECP deadline while Markus was working on writing tests and hooking up Travis CI.
> In retrospect, it really wasn't that bad--everything seems easy once you know it--but it can seem challenging when you don't even know where to start.
> I was very close to going with tools I was more familiar with (LaTeX, HTML) and alternatives (e.g., Doxygen) but am glad I bit the bullet and went with RTD, Sphinx and RST.
> With the amount of documentation we now have, it would have been impossible to scale things up with a less capable documentation tool chain.

**Editor's note:** Humans are often bad at judging cost/benefit trade offs.
When the [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov) project [transitioned from Subversion to git/GitHub](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/continuous-technology-refreshment-an-introduction-using-recent-tech-refresh-experiences-on-visit), we were all worried about the added time and effort needed to review each other's pull requests.
Within just a week or two of being on GitHub, we had caught enough problems in PR reviews that we were quickly convinced the cost was worth the benefit.

> When it comes to SSE practices (e.g. testing, documentation, code quality, and portability), I think [zfp] is in a good place when compared with other, similar packages.
> Developers working on similar packages have even commented that [zfp] works out of the box without hitches while other packages do not fair so well...something even documented in published papers.

> On the other hand, [zfp] is basically a two-person team and there's only so much we know.
> Compared to efforts like MFEM and RAJA, I feel that we have much to learn in terms of SSE practices.
> These projects have much larger teams, however, so maybe the comparison is unfair.

> I'm actually grateful that I got to spend this time to learn how to take a research prototype and transition it into a product that's being widely used and even productized by a big company like Intel.
> Yes, I'm doing far less research today, but I also enjoy developing [zfp] and am proud of the work we've done.
> So I have no regrets in that regard.

> I also do think that I'm busier than ever.
> Leading [zfp] R&D is (or at least could be) a full-time job.
> I would love to hire more SEs and researchers (maybe a postdoc) to expand the [zfp] team, but there's currently no budget for that.
> That would also mean more time overseeing people and less time doing what I truly enjoy--getting my fingers dirty.

> Something that I have contemplated (if I had the funds) is standing up a small committee/council/advisory team to guide design decisions and help with software engineering issues.
> These would be people I could go to with difficult questions that I feel experienced industry experts who develop real products would know how to answer and where I feel I lack expertise.
> These would also be people with some familiarity with the [zfp] code base.

> One challenge with [zfp] is that we support so many languages, back-ends, and other products and use cases (including storage, I/O, communication, host-device transfers, in-memory array representation), and I'm at best a novice with respect to most of them.
> Similarly with SSE, e.g., when it comes to designing classes and APIs, and even how to best implement certain functionality (thread-safe compressed-array views come to mind).
> There are also design issues to consider in terms of performance, e.g., to make [zfp] hardware friendly, to make it easily parallelizable for GPUs, etc.
> I can't be an expert on all these topics, so having access to those who do these things for a living would be valuable.
