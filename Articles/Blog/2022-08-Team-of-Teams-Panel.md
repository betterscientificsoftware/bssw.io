### Introduction

The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) core mission is to develop a capable exascale computing ecosystem that
accelerates scientific discovery and supports addressing critical challenges
in energy, Earth systems, materials, data, and national security. The
nature of this mission has drawn a wide range of talented and successful
scientists with diverse backgrounds to work together in new ways toward this
goal. As we work together, we want to accelerate and leverage the agility that
occurs in small teams — and scale it out to the HPC community.

On August 25, Elaine Raybourn of Sandia National Laboratories hosted the next
in the [Strategies for Working Remotely Panel Series](https://www.exascaleproject.org/remote-panel-archive/)
titled
“[What Can Be Learned from Applying Team of Teams Principles to the ECP Projects PETSc, Trilinos, xSDK, and E4S?](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/team-of-teams1/)”
Panelists Todd Munson (Argonne National Laboratory), Ulrike Yang
(Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and Jim Willenbring
(Sandia National Laboratories) explored lessons learned from their
experiences with these projects as viewed
from the lens of a “Team of Teams.” Intermixed with these panelists were
commentators Reed Milewicz (Sandia National Laboratories) and Benjamin Sims (Los Alamos National Laboratory), who injected valuable commentary on themes as
they appeared throughout the discussion.

“Team of Teams,” as defined by Stanley McChrystal,<sup>[1]</sup> has the following key aspects:

- Shared consciousness — as shown by an aligning narrative that answers basic
  questions: What is the mission? What is our role in this larger organization?
- Empowered execution — as shown by autonomous decision-making ability
- Leading like a gardener — as shown by leaders that favor guiding,
  facilitating, nurturing, and empowering the growth of the ecosystem rather
  than directing as in game of chess
- Liaisons — as demonstrated by participants who are part of different teams at
  once, enabling them to build networks and break down silos.

The panelists talked about ways that these aspects are manifest in practice.
From the discussion, several common themes emerged:

### Individual Team Autonomy

What makes a team a team? A team is characterized by its trust, common purpose,
shared consciousness, and general autonomy. This is true of each team within a
Team of Teams – as well as being empowered by leadership to autonomously execute.

Todd Munson described this in his discussion of [PETSc](https://petsc.org/) in which he explained
how their ecosystem of teams is layered (Figure 1):

> A lot of things inside of PETSc are focused on the individual contributors.
> They are responsible for choosing where and what they do in PETSc. We have a
> process with merge requests, but ultimately we have a set of individuals who
> form into smaller teams (2-5 people) who work on key features/aspects.
> They are the ones who are choosing the activities they pursue.

<br>

PETSc is not alone in relying on small developer groups to own individual
packages. Ulrike Yang detailed a different picture to much of the same effect
on behalf of the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit ([xSDK](https://xsdk.info/))
(Figure 2).

<br>

<img src='../../images/team-of-teams-figure-2.png' class='page lightbox'>[Figure 2: The individual network of packages within xSDK]

<br>

As of the 0.7.0 release (November 2021), xSDK, an infrastructure for and
interoperability of a collection of related and complementary software elements,
contained 24 diverse packages. Each of these packages is maintained and
developed by individual teams, all fitting within the larger Team of Teams
structure. As Ulrike observed:

> For the xSDK product, the vision was to provide infrastructure and
> interoperability for independently developed math libraries made by
> different teams with different strategies.

If every team is doing work to advance their own goals, however, how do they
fit into the larger ecosystem? This is where the next theme comes into play.

### Leading Like a Gardener

Each panelist noted the need for a leadership group to keep the shared goals
and holistic vision on each individual team's radar. Jim Willenbring had this
to say on the topic with respect to the Extreme-scale Scientific Software
Stack ([E4S](https://e4s-project.github.io/)):

> Defining and communicating the value of something like the E4S requires a
> leader to champion the reasons motivating the work and benefits of working
> collaboratively.  Those reasons shift over time, so the community as a whole
> needs to maintain an awareness of those shared goals, stepping up and
> guiding them when needed.

What this looks like varies between the different represented communities.
For PETSc, the overarching leadership organizes open forum calls for the
development community and utilizes tools such as Slack, email lists, and GitHub’s
issue tracker. For xSDK, the leadership group assists with enforcing
community policies to ensure interoperability and minimum quality standards.

Some teams have gained decades of experience with this exact aspect.
Jim Willenbring on behalf of [Trilinos](https://trilinos.org) had this to say:

> A lot of responsibilities fall on boundaries between teams —
> like the packages without dedicated maintainers or certain porting efforts.
> Tools and technologies are also being used in different cases. There
> have been improvements in these areas. Our leadership structure evolved to
> support development, including identifying roles on the boundaries between
> teams. Along with this, planning and transparency have improved,
> establishing expectations for other teams and involving more
> stakeholders. Communication is also more frequent and detailed.

Here Jim touched on the final theme.

### Communication Is Key

Communication is where all the themes of this panel come together. Without
effective and intentional communication, whether remotely or in person, there
can be no synergistic ties between teams, and therefore, no Teams of Teams.

Every individual team will have its own communication style and workflow. They
may use GitHub Issues, email, Slack, etc., to communicate about their
individual activities. When it comes to the larger ecosystem of a Team of Teams,
however, this communication must become more intentional and targeted. The
conscious usage and commitment to communication styles can make or break a
Team of Teams. Each single team has their own responsibilities and goals they
wish to achieve, and this can lead to redundancy and lack of efficiency if not
carefully addressed and avoided.

Panelist Jim Willenbring in his exploration of E4S noted:

> If you can make different teams that are near to other teams’ efforts aware
> of their issue trackers and overall workflows, and you can manage to inject
> topics or concerns directly into their workflow, that really helps
> [break down silos]. If you just send an email or mention your concerns at a meeting,
> they may or may not gain traction.

Additionally, the “Liaison” role noted by McChrystal applies directly here.
Every panelist mentioned two essential requirements that enabled their Team of
Teams identities:

1. Core team members with strong responsibilities for maintaining the
   community — thus acting as a liaison in some part of their role.
1. Policies that define and promote shared goals, which effectively require
   work scope that falls between projects to implement.

As a final observation on the topic of communication, panelists noted that
Teams of Teams are often geographically dispersed, generally as a side effect
of the scale of the overarching ecosystem. Because of this, they often make use
of remote or hybrid work models, and did so even before the COVID pandemic.
Commentator Benjamin Sims noted that remote collaboration tools are more
accepted and accessible than ever because of the pandemic, thus opening the
door to new and more effective models of virtual collaboration and
communication. As Todd Munson reflected in relation to PETSc,

> During the pandemic, [we wanted to] make targeted goals transparent. We use
> Slack, Zoom calls, email lists, as well as GitHub issue tracker. We like
> using those products and they work well for us to keep everyone informed.

Widely distributed Teams of Teams can also be highly diverse. As Ulrike Yang
explained, this impacts communications on the xSDK development team, which
spans at least six distinct time zones:

> Differences in language, communication, and personality are
> [prominent cultural] issues. It is harder to resolve these virtually — so
> we try to take advantage of big conferences to meet up, have dinners, etc.,
> which was difficult during the pandemic. Milestones can help drive
> collaboration, which can bridge communication issues and bond. ... We are
> highly diverse — age, gender, race, nationality, technical life experience,
> etc. The large pool of connections provides access to other experts and
> helps drive innovation. The different personalities can also be helpful to
> get past blocks — for example, a positive person can move a stuck project along.

As this comment indicates, even in a world of increasing remote work, some
communication issues are best resolved by meeting and getting to know one
another in person.

### Final Thoughts

We are seeing a shift in the way teams form and interact.<sup>[2]</sup> In the concluding
discussion in which panelists, moderators, and the audience explored what
defines a Team of Teams, commentator Reed Milewicz compared how panelists’
projects were organized to the concept of the “Core-Periphery Structure”
model of open-source software development,<sup>[3]</sup> which is a common form of
top-down governance structure for open-source software projects:

> [In a conventional core-periphery style of organization,] outside community
> members who become involved in the project over time may steadily migrate
> into the core, but the decision power still rests in the core. In science,
> engineering, and mathematics, many teams are increasingly multi-disciplinary
> and multi-institutional. How PETSc members describe themselves involves many
> different teams and communities in a bottom-up approach. By increasing the
> transparency and engagement, they are moving away from having a "core" team.
> This doesn’t come for free, of course — all of these teams may have their
> own goals. But they have to be able to come together and resolve these.
> Once they do, they are able to be more productive than if they were in
> their own silos.

When collaboratively developing scientific software at scale, each actor
brings different needs and perspectives. The governance structure has to evolve
to reflect this. Many teams coming together, each with their own goals,
have to find common ground and common objectives in order to effectively
collaborate. Organizations that incorporate Team of Teams aspects are unique
in being able to incorporate objectives defined by inter-team interactions.
Panelists Todd Munson, Ulrike Yang, and Jim Willenbring explored the Team of
Teams ecosystems on behalf of PETSc, Trilinos, xSDK, and E4S and detailed the
necessity for individuality and empowered autonomy among teams, leadership
to steer and guide the big-vision and holistic goals, and intentional
communication to keep everyone aligned, especially when teams are distributed.
