As we stand at the cusp of a new decade, I want to thank the BSSw community, whose efforts have led to great strides in  building better scientific software. In 2019, the BSSw site was revamped to improve user experience through enhanced site navigation, along with additions to our ever-expanding collection of resources. We thank our international community of contributors who are sharing their philosophies and experiences, as well as our readers from all over the world. In this blog post, we list some of the interesting articles and blogs that have especially resonated with readers. We hope to have a productive and fruitful 2020! Happy new year to our entire community!
