Better Scientific Software is an organization dedicated to improving developer productivity and software sustainability for computational science and engineering (CSE).

The completed Better Scientific Software site will serve as a central hub for sharing information on practices, techniques, experiences, and tools to improve CSE software productivity, quality, and sustainability. 

The site aims to raise awareness of the importance of good software practices to scientific productivity and to the quality and reliability of computationally-based scientific results. Another goal is to raise awareness of the increasing challenges facing CSE software developers as high-end computing heads to extreme scales. 

Once live, we will encourage contributions from the wider CSE community.

For more on what's here and who contributes and why, see the [Site Overview Page](https://bssw.io/pages/site-overview).
