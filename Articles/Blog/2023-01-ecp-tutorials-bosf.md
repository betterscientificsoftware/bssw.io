### Introduction

The [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org) (ECP) includes approximately 1,000 researchers, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, to develop and deliver a capable exascale computing ecosystem to the nation.  To complement the project's Annual Meeting, recently held in person, the ECP has organized a set of online tutorials and online Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions that are open not only to ECP members but also to the larger community.  The ECP project spans 24 computational science and engineering applications across six topical areas, and 70 different software technology products that support them, so these events will cover a wide range of topics in high-performance computing.

### Tutorial Days (February 6-10)

A total of 26 tutorials are scheduled for February 6-10.  Topics of particular interest to readers of BSSw.io include the E4S software stack, CMake, software practices for better science, Julia programming for exascale, as well as both the RAJA and OCCA portability frameworks and OpenMP 5+.  Other tutorials cover various performance tools, numerical libraries, workflow and I/O tools.  Tutorials are free and open to the public.  Registration is required.

### Community BoF Days (February 14-16)

Birds of a Feather sessions, for those not familiar with them, provide forums for communities to gather to discuss topics of interest.  Often part of conferences, such as [Supercomputing](https://supercomputing.org/) and [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/), BoFs provide an alternative to peer-reviewed paper sessions.  Formats vary depending on the organizers and purpose, but they often include presentations, e.g., updates on the topic, shorter lightning talks, or panel-style or more free-ranging discussions.

A total of 24 BoF sessions are scheduled for February 14-16. As with the tutorials, the BoFs cover a wide range of topics that will be of interest to the BSSw community.  We want to call out three for special notice here.  One is on the [BSSw.io site](https://bssw.io/events/2023-ecp-community-bof-for-bssw-io) itself, at which you can find out how to contribute to the site, as well as help us better understand your interests and needs.  Second is an session on the [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/events/2023-ecp-community-bof-for-bssw-fellowship), which provides an opportunity to learn more about how the BSSw fellowship community is impacting better scientific software.  And third is an information session on the [Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing](https://bssw.io/events/argonne-training-program-on-extreme-scale-computing-atpesc-2023) (ATPESC), the annual summer school for which applications are due in March.  The Community BoFs are free and open to the public.  Links to the Zoom sessions are provided on the event website.

### Conclusion

The Exascale Computing Project is offering 60 different tutorials and BoFs for public participation in February.  Please take a look at the offerings and join us as many ECP projects share their work, experiences, and plans.
