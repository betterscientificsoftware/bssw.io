The BSSw site has a new look!  We're enthused to release a new phase of the Better Scientific Software site, incorporating an integrated content map to enable navigation and learning.  
<!-- deck text end -->

The goals of the new content map are to present resources according to six primary categories and various subtopics and to facilitate navigation throughout the site.  Explore the site to learn more about:
- Better Planning
- Better Development
- Better Performance
- Better Reliability
- Better Collaboration 
- Better Skills

We encourage feedback on this new functionality and the site overall.  We would greatly appreciate reports of any difficulties you may encounter.  Please [contact the BSSw team](https://bssw.io/contact) with your comments and suggestions.  

As always, we welcome [contributions to the BSSw site](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software). If you have experience or expertise that can help other scientific software teams, we encourage you to contribute an original article or point users to existing resources you find useful.

Many thanks.

The BSSw development and editorial team
