### The challenges of scientific software documentation

“Documentation.”
For many authors of scientific software, the word evokes a feeling of guilt, or dread.
Have I written enough?
Is what I’ve written any good?
We’re already working outside of our comfort zones — scientists asked to act like professional developers, and vice versa.
To write really great documentation to go along with our software, we’d have to don many more hats: technical writer, information architect, typographer.
If you or your project are able to marshal all those skill sets, that’s wonderful, but most of us will generally have to do the best we can with limited time and resources.
