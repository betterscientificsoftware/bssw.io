#### Publication date: December 18, 2023

We are pleased to announce the 2024 class of Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellows: six Fellows and six Honorable Mentions.

<!-- The 2024 class of BSSw Fellows will be recognized during the [2024 Exascale Computing Project Annual Meeting](https://www.ecpannualmeeting.com), January 17-20, 2024. -->

We sincerely thank _all_ fellowship applicants. The broad range of creative and interesting proposals made the selection process difficult.

The [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software. Each 2024 Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

<!-- mention ASCR and NNSA -->

The BSSw Fellowship Program is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and National Science Foundation (NSF) to enable a more robust approach toward pioneering the future of advanced computing ecosystems and leadership in science and engineering. The program enhances workforce development and pathways to NSF and DOE software communities, through nurturing a network of people who advance software practices as a fundamental aspect of increasing overall scientific productivity.

### About the BSSw Fellowship
The main goal of the [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) is to foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes. BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of an activity that promotes better scientific software. Subscribe to the [BSSw email digest](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest) for notification about next yearâ€™s call for applications, which will be announced in summer 2024. More information:
