Community-developed guidelines for managers of software registries and
repositories will help efforts to increase awareness and recognition of software
as a research product.

Software is a fundamental element of the scientific process, and cataloguing
scientific software is helpful to enable software discoverability. During the
years 2019-2020, theÂ [Task Force on Best Practices for Software
Registries](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#authors)Â of
theÂ [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working
Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group)Â worked to
createÂ [Nine Best Practices for Scientific Software Registries and
Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13117). In this post, we explain why
scientific software registries and repositories are important, why we wanted to
create a list of best practices for such registries and repositories, the
process we followed, what the best practices include, and what the next steps
for this community are.

### Author bios

Alejandra Gonzalez-Beltran leads the Data and Software Engineering Group (DSEG) in the Scientific Computing Department at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, part of UK Research and Innovation. Alejandraâ€™s work revolves around developing models, methods, and software tools for data science and innovative scholarly communication with the aim of enabling Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, research reproducibility and aggregation of research results. DSEG mainly focuses on the design, development and support of high-quality FAIR software to support FAIR data management of the large-scale facilities at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, which include lasers, particle accelerators, neutron and muon sources.

Alice Allen is the Editor of the [Astrophysics Source Code Library](https://ascl.net/) (ASCL), which works to improve the transparency and reproducibility of astronomy research by making the computational methods used in this research more discoverable. She is a member of the [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group), the [SciCodes Consortium](https://scicodes.net/), and the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) Evaluation and Advisory Committee.

Allen Lee is a computer scientist and research software engineer working to (hopefully) improve our abilities to understand and sustainably evolve with the complex adaptive systems that we collectively navigate. I contribute to open science initiatives like the Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences (https://comses.net), help conduct research in [collective action and the commons](https://iasc-commons.org/) ðŸ¤², and serve as a maintainer and instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

Daniel Garijo is a Researcher at the [Ontology Engineering Group](http://www.oeg-upm.net/) of the [Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid](http://www.upm.es/institucional). Daniel's research activities focus on e-Science and the Semantic web, specifically on how to increase the understandability of software and scientific workflows using provenance, metadata, intermediate results and [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html). 

Tom Morrell is the Research Data Specialist at Caltech Library. He is responsible for managing the [CaltechDATA](https://data.caltech.edu/) institutional data and software repository and helping researchers effectively store and share their data and software. Tom also contributes to the [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group), [SciCodes Consortium](https://scicodes.net/), and [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/) repository development.
