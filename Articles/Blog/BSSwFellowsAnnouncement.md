We are pleased to announce the inaugural class of Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellows: four Fellows and four Honorable Mentions.

The inaugural class of BSSw Fellows will be recognized during the [Exascale Computing Project 2nd Annual Meeting](https://www.ecpannualmeeting.com), February 6-9, 2018, in Knoxville, TN.  Thanks to _all_ fellowship applicants. The broad range of creative and interesting proposals made the selection process difficult.

The [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software. Each Fellow will receive up to $10,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

### About the BSSw Fellowship
As described in a [prior blog article](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/applications-open-for-new-bssw-fellowship-program-q-a-webinar-on-dec-12-2017), the main goal of the BSSw Fellowship program is to foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes. BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of an activity that promotes better scientific software. Subscribe to the [BSSw email digest](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest) for notification about next yearâ€™s call for applications, which will be announced in fall 2018.

Stay tuned for more from the 2018 BSSw Fellows.
