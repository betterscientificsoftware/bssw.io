As we wrap up 2025, we want to take a moment to celebrate the people who make BSSw.io what it is: our contributors, readers, and supporters from around the world. 
This year brought another wave of thoughtful articles, practical insights, and shared experiences focused on improving software sustainability, productivity, and quality across the scientific software ecosystem. 
The generosity of our community in openly sharing successes, challenges, and lessons learned continues to be the heart of BSSw.io. 
In this blog post, we highlight a selection of content from 2025 that especially resonated with our readers and reflects the evolving ways we build and sustain scientific software together. 
Thank you for being part of this journey with us. 
We are excited to carry this energy into the year ahead. Happy New Year to the entire BSSw community.

## Building a better scientific software community through your contributions

BSSw remains an open space for sharing ideas, experiences, and practical wisdom around scientific software. 
If you have something to share, whether an article, a blog post, a useful resource, or an event -- we welcome your contributions to the BSSw site and encourage you to join the conversation and [contribute](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software).

Thank you to everyone who makes this community thrive. 
As we move into another year, we’re excited to keep learning together, supporting one another, and shaping the future of scientific software..one contribution at a time.
