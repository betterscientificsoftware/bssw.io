As we wrap up 2025, we want to take a moment to celebrate the people who make BSSw.io what it is: our contributors, readers, and supporters from around the world. 
This year brought another wave of thoughtful articles, practical insights, and shared experiences focused on improving software sustainability, productivity, and quality across the scientific software ecosystem. 
The generosity of our community in openly sharing successes, challenges, and lessons learned continues to be the heart of BSSw.io. 
In this blog post, we highlight a selection of content from 2025 that especially resonated with our readers and reflects the evolving ways we build and sustain scientific software together. 
Thank you for being part of this journey with us. 
We are excited to carry this energy into the year ahead. Happy New Year to the entire BSSw community.

If you possess expertise or experiences that can benefit other scientific software teams, we encourage you to [contribute to the BSSw site](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software). Whether through original articles, blog posts, curated links that highlight web-based content, or [event announcements](https://bssw.io/events), your contributions play a crucial role in fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.

A huge thank you to each and every one of you for making the BSSw community what it is. 
With another year ahead, we’re excited to continue learning, collaborating, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in scientific software. 
We can’t wait to see what we’ll accomplish together—your insights and contributions are what make it all happen!
