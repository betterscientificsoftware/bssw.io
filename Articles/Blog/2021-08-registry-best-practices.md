Community-developed guidelines for managers of software registries and
repositories will help efforts to increase awareness and recognition of software
as a research product.

#### Publication date: August 27, 2021

Software is a fundamental element of the scientific process, and cataloguing
scientific software is helpful to enable software discoverability. During the
years 2019-2020, theÂ [Task Force on Best Practices for Software
Registries](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#authors)Â of
theÂ [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working
Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group)Â worked to
createÂ [Nine Best Practices for Scientific Software Registries and
Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13117). In this post, we explain why
scientific software registries and repositories are important, why we wanted to
create a list of best practices for such registries and repositories, the
process we followed, what the best practices include, and what the next steps
for this community are.

### Why are scientific software registries and repositories important?

Scientific software registries and repositories support identifying and finding
software, provide information for software citation, foster long-term
preservation and reuse of computational methods, and ultimately, improve
research reproducibility and replicability.

### Why did we write these guidelines?

Managers of scientific software registries and repositories have been working
independently to run their services and provide useful information and tools to
users in different communities. The Best Practices for Software Registries Task
Force participants had different perspectives representing a heterogeneous set
of resources, but came together for the common goal of creating a list of best
practices for scientific software registries. These shared practices help to
raise awareness of software as a research output, enable credit for software
creators, and guide curators working on software catalogues through the steps to
consider when setting up their software registries. In the longer term, we hope
to improve the interoperability of the software metadata supported by different
services.

The goals that we considered for writing the guidelines were:

-   to have a minimal number of best practices, easy to adopt by repository
    managers

-   to be broadly applicable to most or all of our resources

-   to be descriptive on a meta level, not prescriptive, and focused on what
        the best practices should do or provide, not on what a suggested policy
        or element should specifically say.

### What are the best practices?

Our guidelines, listed below, provide an overview of the key points to take into
consideration when creating a software registry. They are:

-   Provide a public scope statement
    ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-scope-statement))

-   Provide guidance for users

-   Provide guidance to software contributors
        ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-authorship))

-   Establish an authorship policy

-   Share your metadata schema
        ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-metadata-schema))

-   Stipulate conditions of use
        ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-conditions-of-use-policy))

-   State a privacy policy
        ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-privacy-policy))

-   Provide a retention policy
        ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-retention-policy))

-   Disclose your end-of-life policy
        ([examples](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/Products/BestPractices.html#policy-examples-end-of-life-policy))

[Our pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13117)Â offers more explanation about
each guideline and a longer list of implementations that we found when we were
doing our work on these practices.

### What process did we follow to produce the guidelines?

Representatives from numerous software registries and repositories were involved
in the FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group (SCIWG). Alice
Allen proposed that we form a task force within the SCIWG for writing up some
best practices for the registries and repositories, and with acceptance by the
co-chairs of the SCIWG and interest from relevant people, the Task Force on Best
Practices for Software Registries was formed. Initially, we gathered information
from members of this Task Force to learn more about each resource and to
identify some of our overlapping interests. We then identified potential best
practices based on prior issues we experienced running our services andÂ 
discussed what each potential practice might include or exclude.

Through iterative deliberations, we determined which of the potential practices
were the most broadly applicable. With generous funding from theÂ [Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/), we hosted
a [workshop](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/)Â for scientific
registries and repositories, part of which was devoted to gathering final
consensus around the Best Practices.Â  The workshop included registries who were
not part of the Task Force, resulting in a broader set of contributions to the
final list.

### What are the next steps for the group?

Our goal is to continue our efforts by implementing these practices more
uniformly in our own registries and repositories and reducing the burdens of
adoption. We have created SciCodes, aÂ [consortium of scientific software
registries and
repositories](https://scicodes.net/2021/04/09/welcome-to-scicodes/), which is
now defining the next priorities to tackle, such as tracking the impact of
goodÂ [metadata](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/bi/metadata-importance-in-data-driven-world/),
improving interoperability between registries, and making our metadata more
discoverable by search engines and services such asÂ [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/),Â [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), and
discipline indexes. We are also sharing tools and ideas in aÂ [series of
presentations](https://scicodes.net/presentations/)Â that are recorded and
available for viewing on theÂ [SciCodes website](https://scicodes.net/), so
please check them out!
