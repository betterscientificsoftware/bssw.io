## Introduction
The release of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in late 2022 was a revolutionary step for human-computer interactions. Since then, the AI landscape has evolved rapidly opening new avenues for enhancing software development processes via state-of-the art large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI. Recognizing this potential, the authors published a very first paper [(ICPP-W'23 Godoy, Valero-Lara, et al.)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3605731.3605886) on LLM capabilities for the generation of common math kernels HPC code, while organizing a very first workshop tackling the intersection of AI and scientific software development AI4Dev [(SC'23 Laguna et al.)](https://ai4dev-workshop.github.io/2023/). This vision paid off, as AI is now at the forefront of HPC research and development, shifting paradigms in how scientific software is created, optimized, and maintained. 
Following this initial success, we continued creating the venues in top HPC conferences where researchers and practitioners could share their latest advances in software development aided by AI.
This article summarizes the key insights and advancements related to better scientific software in the recent workshops hosted at ISC'25 and ICPP'25.

## LLM4HPC at ISC'25

The [ISC'25 1st LLM4HPC workshop](https://llm4hpc.github.io/2025/) had two paper presentations in the topic of leveraging LLMs for HPC software development gathering approximately 30 attendees for the first time workshop.

- Rin Tanaka presented the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-07612-0_49) "Analysis of MPI Parallel Code Generated by GPT-4o" showing a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4o's ability to generate parallel code using the standard message passing interface (MPI). Unsurprisingly, they conclude that MPI codes were generated incorrectly even though many passed unit tests. The work was recognized with a best paper distinction by the workshop committee.
  
- Pedro Valero-Lara presented the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-07612-0_47) "Leveraging AI for Productive and Trustworthy HPC Software: Challenges and Research Directions" showcasing the identified research directions to leverage AI for the HPC software development lifecycle. The paper captures the goals and priorities of the US Department of Energy (DOE) funded Durban and Ellora projects as part of the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) "Advancements in Artificial Intelligence for Science" program.

## AI4Dev at ICPP'25

The [ICPP'25 AI4Dev workshop](https://ornl.github.io/events/AI4Dev-ICPP-2025/) featured two paper presentations and a panel discussion on the intersection of AI and scientific software development. The half-day workshop gathered nearly 30 attendees 

- A keynote presentation by Abhinav Bhatele (University of Maryland College Park). titled “Lost in Translation: LLMs and Whole-Repository Porting of HPC Codes,” showcased his group’s research efforts on the capabilities of current LLMs, the current state-of-the-art and limitations in this important topic.

Papers presented:

- Bowen Cui of George Mason University presented the first accepted paper titled “Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs in HPC Code Performance Optimization,” which identified advantages and gaps in LLMs for HPC motif for a real applications. 

- The second paper, “AI Assistants to Enhance and Exploit the PETSc Knowledge Base,” was presented by Junchao Zhang from Argonne National Laboratory. The work showcased how industry-driven AI technologies can enhance the development
process of a well-established Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) library, widely used in HPC. The highlight the fact that as a mature libray, PETSc has valuable by unstructured information, so there is a need to adapt this knowledge along with the niche nature of HPC to make LLM more effective for their project needs.

Panel discussion:

The workshop ended with a panel of experts that are actively working on the use of AI for Development: 

- Sunita Chandrasekaran, University of Delaware, provided a comprehensive overview of ger group efforts on [LLM4VV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X24002449) an ecosystem to leverage LLMs for Validation and Verification for OpenMP and OpenACC test suites.
  
- Ali Jannesari, Iowa State University, presented "AI for HPC Code: From Representation to Generation and Performance Analysis" a recount of the efforts of his [Software Analytics and Pervasive Parallelism Lab](https://swapp.cs.iastate.edu/) covering a broad spectrum of the HPC code development process including their state-of-the-art [CodeRosetta](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/94924) work. 
  
- Jeffrey Carver, University of Alabama, provided an overview at the intersection of HPC and software engineering research including insights on where teams spend their time developing software, positive peer-review experiences, and testing challenges, aspects that can be leverage with the proper use of AI. 
  
- Daniel Nichols, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, presented his research efforts in the last few years on the LLMs capabilities to write parallel code, this include his work on [HPC-Coder](https://github.com/parallelcodefoundry/HPC-Coder) tool and the [ParEval](https://github.com/parallelcodefoundry/ParEval) benchmark suite.  
  
Overall, the panel highlighted the importance of collaboration between AI researchers and HPC software developers to address the unique challenges in this domain.

## Future directions and events

AI is here to stay as the largest technological revolution of our time, and HPC software development can be largely improved by leveraging AI technologies. Through these workshops, we summarized some of the findings and insights from the community experts at the intersection of AI and HPC.

For those interested in community activities or submitting papers in this topic, the following upcoming workshops are planned for 2026:

- [LLM4HPCAsia at SCA/HPC Asia'26](https://ornl.github.io/events/llm4hpcasia2026/)
- [LLM4HPC at ISC'26](https://ornl.github.io/events/llm4hpc2026/)
- [HPAI4S at IPDPS'26](https://sites.google.com/view/hpai4s/)
