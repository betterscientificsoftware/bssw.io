Anticipating what could go wrong is an essential part of becoming a master craftsperson. 
An important part of that process is reflecting on and learning from mistakes made along the way.
This blog article draws analogies to perspectives in defensive programming.

### From journeyman to master craftsperson

We tend to have a romanticized notion of craftspeople and artisans as
skillful creators striving for perfection, every time. That perception may of
course be misplaced, but at least historically, becoming a master
stonemason, master carpenter, or master metal maker was a serious
undertaking in my country of origin, Germany: it required three years
and one day as a
[journeyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_years). During
that time, apprentices would live a
rather spartan life: they would travel the country, stay with and
learn from masters, and forego marriage as well as most worldly
possessions other than what they could carry.

Maybe we don't need to apply quite such monk-like dedication to
becoming good software engineers. But I think that the way I imagine
these journeyman years to have been, still holds useful lessons. I suppose
that a lot of classes in "STNM 501: Intro to Stone Masonry" would have been
of the form "If you put the chisel to this place of the rock, it will
flake off in that way, and you end up with the shape you are looking
for." That's like writing software: translating an abstract algorithm
into code. The part that I imagine as so much more interesting comes
in "STNM 502: Advanced Stone Masonry": "Think about what happens if you put
the chisel in that place but you accidentally hit it at the wrong
angle with your hammer because you're distracted by the beautiful sunset? 
Then you flake off a much larger piece, and because you can't glue
rock back together, the piece is ruined and you need to start from
scratch." To put this differently: when we do things, we shouldn't
just know how to do things right, but we should *plan for the kinds of
mistakes we tend to make* on a daily basis. It is this kind of
planning that makes the "every time" possible in my first sentence
above.

I have kind of a long history with this notion of planning for failure
— longer than I've been programming. Some 30 years ago, when I was a
teenager, my mom told me about a colleague who had slipped on icy
stairs, and — *because his hands had been in his pockets* —
couldn't catch his fall and cracked a couple of ribs. I really
can't say why this particular story stuck with me, but it's become a
key piece of how I've approached programming: keep your
hands out of your pockets if there is a risk that you might slip. Or,
more concretely: even if you are pretty sure that your code is
correct, build a safety net anyway. In software design, this would be
called [defensive
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming),
which is a form of [defensive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_design).

### It's a mindset question

It's definitely a good habit to use defensive techniques, 
and I'll provide a few examples of defensive programming below.
But I think that the *real* lesson of the story is actually a different one: we all
make mistakes. Some have consequences that are quite annoying (cracked
ribs, broken software). But what I think sets good programmers apart
is not that once they run into a bug, they fix it. It is that
*then they go for a walk around the block*, 
go back in time and wonder what was on their mind when they wrote the code
with the bug. *How* did it come that I wrote the code with the bug?
What could I have done differently to avoid this bug in the first
place? What could I have done to find the bug quicker, and what
mistakes did I make that resulted in it taking this long?

The idea of this mindset is not to be annoyed at having to spend a couple
of hours fixing a bug, but rather to see it as an opportunity to learn how to
become better at programming, debugging, or essentially anything
else. To learn something about how *you* work and 
how you can work around your own limitations. To see cracked ribs as an
opportunity to understand that slipping on ice happens, but that it doesn't
have to have grave consequences if one anticipates it and guards
against it.


### An example

Let me show you a simple piece of code, not untypical of the kind we all write
when dealing with geometry in three-dimensional spaces:
```
   class Point3d
   {
     private:
       double coordinates[3];
     public:
       double &  operator[] (const unsigned int c)
       {
         return coordinates[c];
       }
   };
```
Sooner or later, we will want to add points together:
```
   Point3d operator+ (const Point3d &p1,
                      const Point3d &p2)
   {
     Point3d x;
     for (unsigned int c=0; c<=3; ++c)
       x[c] = p1[x] + p2[c];
     return x;
   }
```
I suspect you all noticed: there's a bug in this function — the
loop should have run only while `c<3`, not `c<=3`. That's a nuisance.
The bug is likely difficult to find because the three coordinates of the
sum object were computed correctly, but I wrote past the end of the
`coordinates` array. So the error would not have been visible immediately
and would have manifested only when I found myself confused that some other
variable did not seem to store the value it should have had. It may
take an afternoon to debug this problem.

These things happen. I know I make mistakes, I fix them, I walk around the
block once and *resolve to be more careful with loop indices in the future*.
I feel good about having found the bug and about having thought about
its root causes.

Three months later I write code that has a similar problem:
```
   double dot_product (const Point3d &p1,
                       const Point3d &p2)
   {
     double sum = 0;
     for (unsigned int c=0; c<=3; ++c)
       sum += p1[x] * p2[c];
     return sum;
   }
```
This time, my walk around the block is not as pleasant. I have to admit to myself
that I thought I had a plan last time, but that it didn't work — apparently,
my brain makes these kinds of mistakes. Resolving to be more careful
doesn't seem to work: I need a different strategy
*that acknowledges that I make these kinds of mistakes*, that I make
them frequently, and that apparently I am unable to stop myself from
making them.

The way to do this in the current context is to let the program itself
help me find those places where I make mistakes:
```
   class Point3d
   {
     ...
       double &  operator[] (const unsigned int c)
       {
         assert(c<3);
         return coordinates[c];
       }
   };
```
The assertion will terminate the program if the condition `c<3` is not
satisfied. For both of the wrong pieces of code above, I would have been
alerted to the problem right away, and it would have been a matter of a
minutes to fix them — no need for difficult debugging.

The point I'm trying to make is not that the assertion is a good way
to help me debug code (though of course it is), but that I put it there
because *introspection has allowed me to understand what kinds of mistakes
I often make*, and how I can learn to live with it.


### Defensive programming

Assertions are one component of "defensive programming". I use them
extensively in all of the codes I work on. For example, the [deal.II
finite element library](https://www.dealii.org)'s core currently
consists of a large amount of C++
code, of which about 122,700 lines contain a semicolon (a measure of
the size of a code); nearly 12,800 of these lines contain an
assertion. It is not uncommon to see functions such as the following one that
extracts from a solution vector those values that are active on a cell
to which a `CellAccessor` object points (lightly edited to avoid
unnecessary details):

```
template <typename ForwardIterator>
void
CellAccessor::get_dof_values(const Vector      &values,
                             ForwardIterator    local_values_begin,
                             ForwardIterator    local_values_end) const
{
  Assert(this->dof_handler != nullptr,
         ExcMessage("The CellAccessor object is not initialized."));
  Assert(this->is_artificial() == false,
         ExcMessage("Can't ask for DoF indices on artificial cells."));
  Assert(this->is_active(),
         ExcMessage("Cell must be active."));
  Assert(local_values_end - local_values_begin == this->get_fe().dofs_per_cell,
         ExcMessage("The output range has the wrong size."));
  Assert(values.size() == this->get_dof_handler().n_dofs(),
         ExcVectorDoesNotMatch());

  const types::global_dof_index *cache =
    this->dof_handler->levels[this->present_level]
    ->get_cell_cache_start(this->present_index, this->get_fe().dofs_per_cell);
  DoFAccessorImplementation::Implementation::
    extract_subvector_to(values,
                         cache,
                         cache + this->get_fe().dofs_per_cell,
                         local_values_begin);
}
```
The actual implementation in the last few lines is unimportant
here; the point simply is: the function has three input arguments
(plus the `this` pointer) that could all be wrong or in undefined
states, and we should check that they are valid individually and in
combination — because you bet that
at some point someone will write code calling this function and do so while the
sun is setting beautifully, and it will be immediately followed by a night figuring why
the code doesn't work.


Many other strategies make it easier for me to live
with the bugs I often seem to introduce. For example, I mark as many
variables as possible as `const` because it helps me avoid
accidentally modifying things I assume have a fixed value. I use a
naming scheme and consistent indentation style everywhere because that
makes reading the code easier. If a variable counts something, it is
marked as `unsigned`. As in the code above, I assert that all input
variables of a function are within valid ranges.

Other approaches that fall into the same category are of course that
all software needs to have good tests. Every experienced programmer
knows that complex software that isn't tested isn't just in the
category where it *may* not work, but in fact in the category where it *does* not work. 
For software that continues to be developed (nearly all
software), that also implies that testing must be part of the
development process, for example as part of a Continuous Integration
framework. Some would advocate that tests should also check every
assertion in the code to ensure that they trigger when they are needed;
in my view, that may be going too far, but I appreciate the spirit
of anticipating that one may also make mistakes writing assertions.

### Summary

The point I want to make here is not that defensive programming is
good (though it unambiguously is), but what made people think about it in the
first place: all of these techniques ultimately came about because of
unpleasant walks around the block coming to terms with the fact that
we make mistakes and apparently can't seem to stop ourselves from
making mistakes.

This *process* of *reflecting about what we do and how we do it* is an
important component at getting better at what we do. We can do this by
walking around the block after each debugging session. Others keep a
journal in which they write their insights about how they work,
possibly illustrating their thoughts with code snippets or screenshots
from their own work. I require students in some of my classes to do
this, and indeed there is research that says that this kind of
"[reflective
writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_writing)" leads to
deeper learning of processes and practice. At the end of the day, what's important
is *forcing* ourselves to be introspective and learn how we, as
software engineers, operate.
