Applications are now open for the 2024 BSSw Fellowship Program, which gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software.

Addressing scientific software challenges magnified by rapidly changing computing environments requires broad community collaboration to improve developer productivity and software sustainability—as key aspects of ensuring the integrity of computational results and increasing overall scientific productivity.

The [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) provides recognition and funding for leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software who foster practices, processes, and tools to improve scientific software productivity and sustainability.
BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity which promotes better scientific software through a publicly available artifact.
We select at least three Fellows per year and honorable mentions as appropriate.
Each 2024 BSSw Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for their proposed activity.
Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community, including broadening participation or promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.
