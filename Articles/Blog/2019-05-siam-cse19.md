It turns out that sometimes you do get a second chance! The software-related sessions we organized at the recent SIAM 
Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Conference are now available online.

One activity that is important for producing better scientific software is sharing information about *how* we work.  In CSE, most conferences, workshops, and journals focus on scientific results and advances in algorithms and methodologies that help create them.  Fewer opportunities exist to discuss the process of developing software---which provides the foundation for CSE collaboration and scientific discoveries.  So we, and others in the community (such as [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)), try to create opportunities for such discussions to take place, through building on-line communities (like [BSSw](https://bssw.io)), training events, workshops and focused sessions within larger conferences, as well as other types of events, such as "Birds of a Feather" sessions at conferences like Supercomputing and ISC.

### Software discussions at SIAM conferences

Some conferences organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) have been particularly good venues for such discussions.  SIAM meetings are largely organized by the attendees, who propose "minisymposia" on topics of their choice, with up to four speaker slot per block.  And while like many other scientific meetings, SIAM conferences also include poster sessions, SIAM is unique in our experience in providing opportunities for "minsymposteria" -- topical groups of posters organized together in space and time, similarly to the talks of a minisymposium.

The SIAM CSE Conference attracts a broad range of researchers to discuss many aspects of CSE (it's not just "math").  With diverse attendees, and opportunities to create sessions tailored to our interests, we've found it a great venue to organize sessions on software development, productivity, sustainability, and reuse.  The organizers of the SIAM CSE conference series recognize the importance of software and have been supportive of sessions on this theme, which have expanded as the conference itself has grown. 

### Software-related sessions at SIAM CSE19

The CSE19 conference took place in late February in chilly Spokane, Washington.  But thanks to the organizers, whose support for discussions about software led them to selected three minisymposia on software-related topics to be recorded and made available online, and to the speakers, who were unanimously willing to participate, recordings of these three minisymposia and their 20 speakers, as well as 28 posters from our topical poster session, are available for you to view at your leisure.

- **Minisymposium: Scientific Software: Practices, Concerns, and Solution Strategies**
  - *Recordings*: [part 1](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/10878/sections/14354) [part 2](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/10878/sections/14355)
  - *Abstract*: Software is an increasingly important component of scientific research. It would not be an exaggeration to say that almost all forms of scientific research today involve software, whether to compute, to manage, or to analyze. The kinds of software used and the associated issues, which range from technical to sociological, are as diverse as the scientific communities themselves. This minisymposium reflects this rich diversity, including presentations from software developers, users, and scientific project managers from various parts of the world and from various science communities. The common thread among these topics is that many overlapping subsets of scientific software issues are of interest to various participants. The minisymposium will, therefore, be a snapshot of the current state of practices, concerns and solution strategies in the world of scientific software.
- **Minisymposium: Toward Software Ecosystems for Computational Science and Engineering**
  - *[Recordings](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/10878/sections/14362)*
  - *Abstract*: Software---cross-cutting technology that connects advances in mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering---is a cornerstone of long-term collaboration and progress in computational science and engineering (CSE). As we leverage unprecedented high-performance computing resources to work toward predictive science, software complexity is increasing due to multiphysics and multiscale modeling, the coupling of simulations and data analytics, and the demand for greater reproducibility and sustainability, all in the midst of disruptive architectural changes. Applications increasingly require the combined use of independent software packages, whose development teams have diverse sponsors, priorities, software engineering expertise, and processes for development and release. The developers of open-source scientific software are increasingly encouraging community contributions and considering more effective strategies for connections among complementary packages. This speakers in this minisymposium will discuss work toward broader software interoperability and scientific software ecosystems needed to support next-generation CSE.
- **Minisymposium and Minisymposterium: Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE and Data Science**
  - *Recordings*: [part 1](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/10878/sections/14383) [part 2](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/10878/sections/14384)
   - *[Posters](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4410767)*
  - *Abstract*: Software is the key crosscutting technology that enables advances in mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering to achieve robust simulations and analysis for predictive science, engineering, and other research fields. While software is becoming more complex due to multiphysics and multiscale modeling, the coupling of data analytics, and disruptive changes in computer hardware (due to increases in typical system scale and heterogeneity, including GPUs and additional alternative architectures), software itself has not traditionally received focused attention in the CSE community or been rewarded by that community. The presenters in this minisymposterium will address work that addresses growing technical and social challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability, and thereby helps software fulfill its critical role as a cornerstone of long-term CSE collaboration. 

Whether you missed CSE19, attended other sessions (there were a lot), or you want to view them again, we hope that you will enjoy these materials and that you'll join us at a future conference.  In addition to SIAM CSE meetings, we also often organize events at SC, ISC, PASC, and others. If you're organizing such events too, or want to get involved, we'd love to hear from you!
