It turns out that sometimes you do get a second chance! The software-related sessions we organized at the recent SIAM Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Conference are now available online.

One activity that is important for producing better scientific software is sharing information about *how* we work.  In CSE, most conferences, workshops, and journals focus on scientific results and advances in algorithms and methodologies that help create them.  Fewer opportunities exist to discuss the process of developing software---which provides the foundation for CSE collaboration and scientific discoveries.  So we, and others in the community, try to create opportunities for such discussions to take place, through workshops and focused sessions within larger conferences, as well as other types of events, such as "Birds of a Feather" sessions at conferences like Supercomputing and ISC.

### Software discussions at SIAM conferences

Some conferences organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) have been particularly good venues for such discussions.  SIAM meetings are largely organized by the attendees, who propose "minisymposia" on topics of their choice, consisting of up to four speaker slots per block.  Like many other scientific meetings, SIAM conferences also include poster sessions.  But SIAM is unique in our experience in providing opportunities for "minsymposteria" -- topical groups of posters organized together in space and time, similarly to the talks of a minisymposium.

The SIAM CSE Conference attracts a broad range of researchers to discuss many aspects of CSE (it's not just "math").  With a diverse crowd, and opportunities to create sessions tailored to our interests, we've found it a great venue to organize sessions on software development, productivity, sustainability, and reuse.  The organizers of the SIAM CSE conference series recognize the importance of software and have been supportive of sessions on this theme, which have expanded as the conference itself has grown.

### Software-related sessions at SIAM CSE19

The [CSE19](https://www.siam.org/Conferences/CM/Conference/cse19) conference took place in late February in chilly Spokane, Washington.  But thanks to the organizers, who selected some sessions to be recorded and made available online, and to the speakers, who were unanimously willing to participate, recordings of three minisymposia on software-related topics (20 speakers), as well as 28 posters from our topical poster session, are available for you to review at your leisure.

Whether you missed CSE19, attended other sessions (there were a lot), or you want to review them again, we hope that you will enjoy these materials, and that you'll join the discussions at a future conference.  In addition to SIAM CSE meetings, we also often organize events at Supercomputing, ISC, PASC, and others. If you're organizing such events too, or want to get involved, we'd love to hear from you!
