This is just a simple file added as a fake blog post
to test forked workflow.

It would be nice if I spell checked phurst.

How do we spell check markdown?

Turns out aspell doesn't do too bad a job, if you have the right
configuration file for it.

Spell checking within a github-web interface only workflow may be problematic. I don't know.
