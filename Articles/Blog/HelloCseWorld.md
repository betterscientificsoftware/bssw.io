["Hello World!"](https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/)
is the canonical *first* program beginners write to learn new programming methodologies.
In computational science and engineering ([CSE](https://bssw.io/pages/intro-to-cse))
circles, programming methodologies can involve a variety of languages, parallel execution
and programming models, discretization techniques, interdependent libraries, and more.
An application solving the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation)
represents the perfect "Hello World!" program for the CSE world.

### What is the heat equation?
The heat equation, a special case of the diffusion equation, was developed by Joseph
Fourier in 1822. It describes how the distribution of heat varies over space and time
in a material. While there are many adaptations for different scenarios, beginner CSE
programmers often start with the one-dimensional, homogeneous heat equation as an
introductory problem,

_&part;u / &part;t = &alpha;&nabla; &sup2;u_

where:
* _u_ = Temperature
* _t_ = time
* _&alpha;_  = thermal diffusivity of the material
* _&nabla;_ = The Laplace operator.

To make the equation even more approachable, we make some simplifying assumptions:
* _&alpha;_ is constant (the material is homogeneous).
* Apart from initial/boundary conditions, there are no other heat sources.
* Only Cartesian coordinates in 1 dimension are used.

### Why this form of the heat equation?
The one-dimensional heat equation might not be sufficient to
model solar heating of the Earth. However, even in this relatively simple form,
interesting and meaningful science questions may be investigated involving
both transient and steady-state behavior. Examples are determining whether water
pipes embedded in the walls of a log cabin (solid wood) would freeze during a cold
storm, or computing the required thickness of insulation around fuel pipeline to avoid
combustion from a fast burning brush fire. These and many other questions
involving heat flow can be investigated with this relatively simple form of
the heat equation.

Solutions to the one-dimensional heat equation are easy for
beginners to visualize, which can help with understanding how different
approaches work. The simplicity of the physics and mathematics also
allows beginners to focus more on the implementation details, such as the
programming language, parallel execution paradigm, discretization, and
mathematical support libraries.

### A repository for 'Hello CSE World' 
We are announcing the beginning of an effort to populate and maintain a
repository of working implementations of the heat equation demonstrating various
aspects of CSE software. The resulting repository will be useful in training
about fundamental aspects of the design and development of CSE software as
well as providing examples of continuous integration (CI) testing, including
demonstrating the use of CI resources for the DOE Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org)).

Each implementation we gather will have to conform
to a *minimal* set of requirements, including providing a fully self-contained
build, accommodating a common set of command-line arguments, producing ascii
text files for results output, and providing ways to probe time and space performance
behavior via tools such as [PAPI](https://icl.utk.edu/papi/) or
[Caliper](https://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/).

Our goal in collecting such examples isn't so much to demonstrate the use of
different programming languages as it is to demonstrate different approaches
to computation and execution paradigms as well as to provide instructive insights
by comparing of time, space, and scaling performance of various approaches.

As a precursor to that effort, we have begun collecting, documenting, and comparing
similarities and differences of
various code snippits from existing implementations in a
[*temporary repository*](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/hello-heat-equation).
After evaluating them, we will then evolve a subset of these code snippits to full, working
implementations we intend to maintain for the training and testing example purposes
described above.

### Conclusion
The heat equation is well known and has many practical applications even in
its one-dimensional form. Because of these advantages, a variety of implementations are
easily available. This exemplar PDE makes it the perfect "Hello World!" for
the scientific software community. Collecting a number of working examples
together with unique implementation characteristics will help to create 
useful introductory CSE training material.
