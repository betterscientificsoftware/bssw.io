Leah Wasser is the Executive Director and founder of an organization called pyOpenSci, a Python open source and open science community of practice. pyOpenSci supports the scientific Python tools that drive open science through peer review, training, and community building. Her BSSw Fellowship, however, offers her the chance to expand beyond Python and provide critical collaboration skills for scientists trying to create software, share their code, and work together collaboratively using GitHub. 

“There are communication and collaboration skills that everyone needs. For instance, understanding asynchronous communication can be really tricky, and the peer review process of code can be really intimidating,” says Leah. “I am excited to have the opportunity to fill those skills gaps in the ecosystem.”

A Remote Sensing Ecologist by training, she has taught data intensive science for nearly 20 years, with the last 10 devoted to open source software. During her BSSw Fellowship, she is expanding on the work she has done with pyOpenSci, creating a multi-lesson self-paced online module that teaches often-missed technical and social collaboration skills needed to contribute to open source software. 

Modules will focus on skills such as using constructive and specific language and code examples that simplify problem solving, building trust with volunteer maintainers, providing reproducible code for bug reports, and referencing issue history when submitting bugs. Modules will also cover fundamental GitHub collaboration skills, including forking, cloning, and pull requests. 

The lessons will be reviewed by the pyOpenSci community  to ensure they are community driven and then published online as free open education resources. The goal of the lessons is to make it easier for scientists to work together collaboratively and for anyone to contribute to open source software. “Even though I have been awarded the fellowship, I see this work as a community resource,” says Leah. “I am really grateful that BSSw empowered me to do more of this work for the broader community.”
