The 2021 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE21) took place in early March 2021.  The meeting was notable for being the first CSE conference held exclusively online—and for hosting the largest number of registered participants in the history of the conference.  CSE21 also hosted the largest array of software-focused sessions the conference has seen to date, with contributions from more than 60 different presenters.

The SIAM Computational Science and Engineering conference series has always been a good place to talk about *software*.  SIAM's crowd-sourcing approach to organizing many of its conferences encourages the community to submit to the conference multi-speaker sessions around topics of interest.  The organizers of the CSE conference series recognize the centrality of *software* to the practice of computational science and engineering, and they've always welcomed such topics.  While many workshops and conferences focus on new science and new algorithms, at CSE it is also possible to hold discussions about the experience of software development and sustainability.  And this year, with the help of sixteen organizers and more than 60 presenters, the conversation around software was one of the most extensive we've seen.  There were seven software-focused minisymposia, each including either five or ten speakers, as well as a topical group of posters, or "minisymposterium."  For those who registered for CSE21, the minisymposia were recorded, and will be available through the vFairs conference platform until June 2021.  **In addition, we've collected the presentations and posters from these software-focused sessions to share with the broader community, as hyperlinked below.** 

Consider joining us in organizing software-focused sessions for future SIAM and other conferences.  The 2022 SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (PP22)—the next conference in CSE's sister series, which alternates years with CSE—will soon be announced.  CSE23 has already been announced for February 2023.  Look for the call for participation in SIAM conferences to appear about 9-10 months in advance of each event.

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship program fosters and promotes practices, processes and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes.  BSSw Fellows are chosen annually to develop a funded activity, such as organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community that promotes BETTER scientific software. This minisymposium sets the stage by Hai Ah Nam, BSSw Fellowship Coordinator, presenting the BSSw Fellowship Program Overview, followed by four (4) BSSw Fellowship alumni sharing their work addressing a diverse range of scientific software topics:
*	Damian Rouson, presents his work Introducing Agile Scientific Software Development to Underrepresented Groups.  He describes his approach to teach scientific software development practices without the software.  Damian’s tutorials integrate a professional development activity (e.g. resume, paper writing) using agile practices to make scientific software development more practical and accessible.
*	Nasir Eisty, describes user surveys identifying challenges, barriers and potential solutions to scientific software testing used to shape his tutorial on Automatic Testing for Scientific Software Development.  Nasir’s tutorial addresses unsolved problems faced while testing scientific software, best practices, along with providing hands-on exercises to help developers produce correct and reliable software.
*	Cindy Rubio-González, presents her work on Improving the Reliability and Performance of Numerical Software through tools and techniques focused on precision tuning for different architectures.  She provides a preview from her soon-to-be-public educational modules on Software Tools for Correctness and Optimization of Scientific Software to teach students and application developers how to balance code correctness with optimization.
*	Kyle Niemeyer, in his talk Educating Scientists on Best Practices for Developing Research Software describes the motivation and design of a modular course that teaches practices for developing research software to graduate students and other researchers, and his experience in teaching this content in various formats. Topics taught include local and remote version control, licensing and copyright, structuring Python modules, testing and test coverage, continuous integration, packaging and distribution, open science, software citation, and reproducibility basics, among others.

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321435](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321435) | SIAM program pages: [MS94](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70102), [MS125](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70103)

Sustainability of software is a major challenge for our community.  This session explored some of the highly varied strategies and approaches to building communities capable of sustaining given software packages.  Speakers addressed leadership strategies to encourage, enable, and empower contributors, recognizing and leveraging the fact that many R&D projects can be thought of as a "team of teams", and the value of particular practices, such as DevOps, the Agile retrospective, and community policies. Other speakers brought experiences with sustainable software from areas including computational molecular sciences, geophysics, subsurface flow, numerical libraries, and tools for code coupling and building and installing software.

### Exascale Computing Project Performance Portability Analysis

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321441](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321441) | SIAM program pages: [MS162](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=69992), [MS192](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=69993)

The U.S. [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) (ECP) is a broad, multi-year project focused on delivering a capable exascale computing ecosystem.  This minisymposium explored the experiences of ECP research teams in achieving portable performance for both the coming generation of exascale computer systems as well as other platforms.  Speakers provided perspectives of the U.S. Department of Energy Leadership Computing Facilities and an overview of the ECP's application development areas, along with deeper dives into a variety of scientific and supporting software technology areas: Earth and space science, energy applications, chemistry and materials science, data analytics and data-centric applications, visualization, data management, programming models, and mathematical libraries.

<!-- Anshu's original 
Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Performance Portability Analysis was a two part symposium that included presentations from several members of the ECP leadership team and from the Science Director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory Computing Facility. The MS was an offshoot of a series of panels that were conducted as a five part series during the summer of 2020. With its focus on preparing a representative set of mission critical applications for the forthcoming exascale platforms, performance portability is a top level concern for the projects, and its leadership has an unparalleled view of where the biggest challenges lie. The ECP is composed of three focus areas: applications, software technologies (ST), and hardware and integration (HI) . Each of the focus area is subdivided into portfolios that group together software with similar domains, features, or challenges. Each portfolio has one member of the leadership team assigned to it. The MS started with a computing facility perspective on preparing for performance portability in presence of heterogeneity of platforms and programming models. Other presentations included a comprehensive overview of applications and their role in the project presented by the deputy lead of the applications area, a comprehensive view of math libraries and software technologies by the ST deputy lead, and description of their portfolios by the leads whose portfolios have to confront the issue of performance portability. It was perhaps the most complete articulation of performance portability challenges and ways to mitigate them for at least the next generation of platforms.

### Data-Driven Analysis of Scientific Software Quality, Availability, and Development Productivity

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321444](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321444) | SIAM program pages: [MS187](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70248)

The widespread availability of public software development repositories and other data sources has enabled new ways of understanding and even improving software development.  This session presented a range of different data-driven activities. One presentation investigated the availability of software mentioned in the literature of a particular domain.  Another used machine learning techniques to determine how to identify and fix bugs in Javascript code.  Other presentations used a variety of data collection techniques, including repository mining to explore software development practices, interactions between projects, long- and short-term tends and anomalies, and the significance of code changes.

<!-- Boyana's original 
The minisymposium on Data-Driven Analysis of Scientific Software Quality, Availability, and Development Productivity started with a presentation by Alice Allen (University of Maryland) on evaluating a portion of the astrophysics literature from 2015 in terms of source code availability and link persistence, finding that 58% of the 285 unique codes discovered in papers were available, but just four years after publication, only 80% of the hyperlinks still worked. The talk by Alexander Grannan of Argonne National Laboratory took a closer look at 15 HPC software projects and explored different aspects of the software practices in these projects through developer interviews, publications, and git data analysis. Next, in Elizabeth Dinella's (University of Pennsylvania) talk, the code itself was the data that the Hoppity framework leverages to detect and fix bugs using graph embeddings of codes and bug fixes from Github Javascript projects. The key idea enabling this approach is that bug fixes can be represented as a sequence of graph edits to the code graph. The last two talks in the session by David Rogers (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and Boyana Norris (University of Oregon) described different software repository mining strategies for discovering interactions between projects, identifying long- and short-term trends or anomalies, estimating the significance of code changes, and easily deriving various development-related statistics from revision control data.

This minisymposium focused on the growing technical, practical, and social challenges in the productivity, quality and sustainability of research software. Speakers discussed case studies and principles of software sustainability, the entrepreneurial nature of even *research* software, aspects pertaining to the people behind research software (including affinity groups, training, and diversity in software teams), and tools to assess and improve software sustainability.

<!-- Rinku's original 
The  “Enhancing Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software” two-part mini-symposium was presented at the  CSE21 conference. The focus of this mini-symposium was to delve into topics related to growing technical, practical, and social challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability for research software from the perspective of teams that build this software. The mini-symposium consisted of diverse speakers with varied backgrounds. Topics ranged from understanding principles of research software sustainability and presenting case studies consisting of well-known research software. Also presented were views on how to measure and improve research software quality and build training tools focusing on software development for researchers. The role of research software engineers  (RSE) in research software development; as well as views on how to enhance diversity in software engineering teams were also shared. Overall, the mini-symposium was a great learning resource for teams and individuals working with research software.
