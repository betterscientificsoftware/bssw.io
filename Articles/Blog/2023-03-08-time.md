# Journaling, Task Managements, Time Tracking for Better Software

#### Contributed by [Robert Underwood](https://robertu94.github.io)

One of the first things that software professionals, scientists, and research software engineers need to master is the ability to manage tasks, understand how they spend their time, and improve their own processes.  
For many, journaling, task managers, and time trackers can help answer these important questions.
However, as David Sparks and Mike Schmitz hosts of the [Focused podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused) put it, "life is about more than cranking widgets".
The goal of these tools is not to enable getting more done -- they probably will --, but to enable people to be better stewards the gift of the time that they has been given.
Writing that extra unit test, releasing that next feature, or removing that stubborn bug while initially satisfying  can never, and will never, truly satisfy.
However, mastering these tools can help make time for what is truly important.

### What is Journaling?

Journaling is a reflective process which aims to capture **tasks**, **observations**, **ideas**, and **lessons** in order to be able to recall and learn from them.
**Tasks** are something actionable that needs to be done -- a bug to fix, a feature to add.
**Observations** describe what happened -- akin to entries in a lab journal observations record what happened.  For example, observations could record what was tired in the process of unraveling some gnarly, pathological, heisenbug to keep better track of what was attempted.
**Ideas** are more unspecific to be processed later: a possible user story or approach to a problem.
Lastly record **lessons**. Lessons record what was needed to accomplish something hard to share with others so they can learn from the experience.

Journaling allows one to process the world at a slower pace by giving you a tool to revisit your tasks, observations, ideas, and lessons at your own pace.
Processing the world slower enables one to make deliberate decisions and to recognize patterns to act differently into the future.
While approaches to journaling change over time and to fit specific needs, two key sets of ideas come from [Bullet Journaling by Ryder Carroll](https://bulletjournal.com/) and [Building A Second Brain by Tiago Forte](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)



#### What Are The Key Components of Journaling?

What to journal and how to journal are deeply personal.
Here are a few of the high level methods to consider:

First, treat the journal as an append only log.  This is a key idea from bullet journaling.  Journaling is most useful when one can record ideas without having to devote substantial amounts of thought to it.
The more friction that there is to journaling, the less it is done, and the less useful it is.  Now one may ask, "if the journal is append only, and everything is jumbled together, how can anyone ever find anything?"  the answer is the second key method.

Second, periodically distill and reflect on what was written.    In these reflections, sort through the notes and tasks to organize what is actually important into more permanent homes.
To emphasize this, bullet journaling recommends doing this with paper journals, because it requires effort to physically copy things from one journal to another, and there is limited space rather than mere copy and paste.
Bullet journaling recommends a daily, weekly, and monthly reflection however some make due with a daily and bi-weekly reflections.
This could for example, align with a teams' sprint cadence.
Building a Second Brain refines this with the approach of *progressive summarization* which is to first go back and underline things that where important, and when at the next "level" of reviews, review everything that was underlined and highlight the most important subset.
This key practice of reviewing things periodically helps derive value from these notes.

The larger the period of the reflection, the more substantial the reflection:

+ daily: what did I do today, what should I do tomorrow, what connections should I make?
+ weekly: what is important this week? What was important from last week? What should I schedule?
+ monthly: what should I stop, start, and continue doing for next month? Are my habits helpful and effective?
+ seasonally: what are my vision/theme/aspirations for this season? How well did I live up to the aspirations for last season? What from this journal is worth migrating to the next?

#### Types Of Journal Entries

Once one becomes accustomed to journaling, here are some of the other ways that to use a journal (several of these are taken from bullet journaling).

1. Daily Log -- the append only log mentioned earlier
2. Kanban List -- a collection of tasks organized into columns of blocked, new, in-progress, done, and backlog tasks.  Kanban boards are no doubt familiar to software developers, but keeping them physically in a journal help  see what was planned to do vs what was actually done (perhaps using different color inks) in a very tactile way.
3. Topic Spreads -- list of related things currated during monthly reviews.  Topic spreads could summarize a literature review, or an architecture of a complex package ; The key thing is to create these as needed, and not in anticipation.
4. Mind Maps -- a spatial way to organize information which can be thought of as an alternative to an outline.  Mind maps aid brain storming and requirements analysis because it doesn't require filling the page in order, allowing revisiting topics as new thoughts arise.
5. Habit Tracking -- a simple set of checklists for each day to track key habits: fix a bug, improve documentation, support a user.  Each team and developer will have their own list.


### What Is Task Management?

In addition to journaling, there is also often a role for a task management system.
Tasks need to be managed or they often are left undone or done without respectfully to priority which hurts longer term goals.
The task management system is a consistent view of all of the tasks that needed to be done rather than the journal which is a strict super-set of this information.
When traveling one could create a page before the trip with all of the tasks to be done to use as their task manager.
When at home, one could keep this information on a large whiteboard near his or her desk -- this is a task manager.
For many,  there is appeal to the tactile nature of moving tasks across their board or checking them off a list.

What goes in the task manager?
The so-called "Eisenhower Square" named for the former US president and general is a good guide.
The Eisenhower square divides tasks along two axis: "urgent and not urgent" and "important and not important".
Tasks that are urgent must be done immediately or as soon as possible.
Tasks that are important help meet broader goals and objectives.
Eisenhower's advice then purportedly goes:

> A task that is urgent and important should be done immediately,
> A task that is urgent, but not important should be delegated [if possible],
> A task that is not urgent, but important should be scheduled, and
> A task that is neither urgent nor important should be discarded.

When recording a task record enough to make it SMART --  specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.

+ Specific -- can it be remembered unambiguously?
+ Measurable -- how the team know when it is done?
+ Attainable -- can one actually possibly accomplish this? This is not always known before hand but try to think this part through beforehand.
+ Relevant -- Is the task related to broader goals and themes?
+ Timely -- what is the deadline or deadlines needed for this task if any?

This information can help determine know how a task fits into larger goals as well as when and how it should be done.

There are often 5 key status:

+ Blocked -- Waiting on something or someone to do something
+ New -- a task that needs to be done soon, but it is not started yet
+ In Progress -- a task that has been started.  Try to limit this to 1-3 tasks to keep focused and avoid context switching.
+ Done -- tasks completed recently so the team can see my progress each week.
+ Backlog -- things that to do someday, maybe.

A related topic to task tracking is calendaring.
As David Sparks says, ["task lists are infinite, but time is finite"](https://www.relay.fm/focused/160).
The calendar is where the task list has be to fit into actual time.
He goes to the extreme of scheduling every hour of his workday -- a practice called [hyper scheduling](https://www.relay.fm/focused/71).
Ultimately both calendars and task lists are useful tools with distinct purposes.

Together journaling _and_ task management provide a structure that enables good task management.
The journal helps reflect on the why of tasks and what was learned along the way.
The task manager gives a single place to look at for everything needed to be done.

### What is Time Tracking?

The last key part of this trio of tools is time tracking.
This is how to measure what was _actually_ done which enables meaningful retrospective and future planning. 
When reviewing time spent, try to think about where was the time spent, where should it have been spent? Why or why not did that happened? What could be automated/delegated?

There are various tools and ways to do this.
The tools can be automatic or manual.
Manual time tracking is straightforward -- just log it in a journal (or in another tool) as doing things through out the day.
Automatic time tracking tools use things like which applications were on screen and/or focused at through out the day.
These tools often require a set of rules to tell the tracking program what each task actually was.
Often people are surprised where they actually spend their time each week.
The best time tracking tools provide informative ways to visualize how time was spent as a summary.

### Tools for Journaling, Task Management, and Time Tracking

People often ask what tools they should use for this.
This is not the important part; what is important is the process of doing something.
Start with paper and pen/pencil because It's cheap, quick, and nearly infinitely flexible.
The important thing about these tools is that they help and don't get in the way.
Feel free to change your tools or use multiple tools for distinct purposes from the same category over time as needs evolve

Here are the tools that I have used or have had recommended to me in the past.  `*` indicates what I use, and `#` indicates personal experience, but not current use.
I apologize to the Android folks,  I don't know that side of the ecosystem as well, but several of these tools work on both.
