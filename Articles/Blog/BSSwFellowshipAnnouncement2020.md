#### Contributed by [Hai Ah Nam](https://github.com/hnamLANL "Hai Ah Nam GitHub Profile")

#### Publication date: December 13, 2019

We are pleased to announce the 2020 class of Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellows: three Fellows and three Honorable Mentions.

The 2020 class of BSSw Fellows will be recognized during the [2020 Exascale Computing Project Annual Meeting](https://www.ecpannualmeeting.com), February 3-7, 2020, in Houston, TX.  

We sincerely thank _all_ fellowship applicants. The broad range of creative and interesting proposals made the selection process difficult.

The [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software. Each 2020 Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

### About the BSSw Fellowship
The main goal of the [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) is to foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes. BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of an activity that promotes better scientific software. Subscribe to the [BSSw email digest](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest) for notification about next yearâ€™s call for applications, which will be announced in summer 2020.
