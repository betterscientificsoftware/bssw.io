The Better Scientific Software organization has awarded four inaugural fellowships, including one to me to make scientific software more sustainable by providing credit to its developers via software citation.

I plan to work with astronomers, physicists, and geoscientists: 
- through conferences,
- with the repositories and services that are used in these fields, and
- with other organizations in these domains that are also concerned with recognizing the role of software and its developers and maintainers in these fields.

I've written [a blog about this that includes my fellowship application](https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/better-scientific-software-fellowship/).
