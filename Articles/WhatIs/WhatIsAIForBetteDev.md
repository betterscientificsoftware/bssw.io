Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in scientific software development to help produce efficient, high-quality, sustainable and maintainable software.
The topic AI for Better Development examines how AI techniques, tools, and emerging environments can support multiple aspects of scientific software engineering.
This includes using AI for assisting with software creation and coding, managing automated configuration or build environments or facilitating release and deployment processes.
AI will also help scientists and research software engineers manage dependencies, analyze workflows, and gain insights across domains and improve overall reliability and sustainability of the code.

Content in this topic area will likely focus on exploring practical applications of AI across different scientific computing domains.
The articles may highlight how AI contributes to stronger software, supports reproducibility, and enables developers to focus on scientific research rather than routine software maintenance.
Articles may also describe lessons learned, best practices, and emerging tools that integrate AI into scientific software workflows.
