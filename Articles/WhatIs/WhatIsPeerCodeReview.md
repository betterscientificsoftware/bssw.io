**Peer Code Review** is a process in which one or more developers inspect another developer's software code to assess the design, user interfaces, software implementation, documentation, and other software-related artifacts.
In addition, these reviews can help to catch potential defects, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, sustainability impediments, and many other software-related issues.
Peer code reviews, along with software testing, provide the foundation for software quality assurance and are an essential part of the software development process.

There are many benefits to performing peer code reviews, including:

* **Improved code quality**: Peer code reviews can help to find defects in code that would otherwise go undetected.
This can lead to improved software quality and reduced risk of defects.

* **Increased security**: Such reviews can help to identify security vulnerabilities in code.
This can help to protect software from becoming a vector for attack.

* **Improved performance**: It can become easier to identify performance bottlenecks in code.
This, of course, results in improving the overall performance of software and making it more responsive to users.

* **Reduced development costs**: Such reviews can lead to reducing the cost of software development by finding (and thereby fixing) defects early in the development process and improving the maintainability and sustainability of the code.
This, in turn, can save time and money that would otherwise be spent on debugging and fixing defects later in the development process.

* **Improved developer skills**: Developers can learn from each other and improve their coding skills based on feedback from reviews.
This can lead to improved productivity and code quality.

* **Improved team collaboration**: Peer code reviews can help to improve team collaboration and communication.
This can lead to more cohesive and productive teams.

One type of asynchronous peer code review is implemented in current platforms like GitHub and GitLab using Pull Requests and Merge Requests, respectively.
These platforms provide many features and options that make conducting high quality code reviews easier for a wide range of developers and projects.

There are a few things to keep in mind when conducting a peer code review:

* **Set clear expectations.** Before the review begins, the author of the code should clearly explain the purpose of the code and the specific areas where they would like the reviewer to focus.

* **Be specific.** When providing feedback, be as specific as possible. This will help the author of the code to understand the issue and how to fix it.

* **Be respectful.** Remember that the author of the code is putting their work out there for review.
Be respectful of their time and effort, and avoid making personal attacks.

* **Be constructive.** The goal of a peer code review is to improve the code, not to tear it down.
Focus on providing constructive feedback that will help the author of the code to improve their code.

* **Be open to feedback.** The author of the code should be open to feedback from the reviewers.
Even if they don't agree with all of the feedback, they should be willing to consider it and make changes to their code as needed.

In summary, peer code reviews are an essential part of the software development process.
They can help to improve the quality of code, reduce the risk of defects, and improve the overall security of software.
If your team is not already conducting peer code reviews, we encourage you to start. You'll be glad you did!
