### What Is Online Learning?

Online learning is gaining vast popularity  - resulting in abundant availability of learning resources that provide opportunities for broad audiences to learn about various topics.

Online learning resources on the internet span a very broad range, from formal courses offered by universities and companies specializing in online learning to less formal and more focused training materials offered by computing facilities, individual educators, and other enthusiasts.  Online learning content comes in many forms as well, ranging from just slides or other written material to full video+audio+slides or screen sharing.  And finally, while the majority of content is available asynchronously (i.e., recorded), many live training events are also available for remote participation.  This topic includes resources with significant emphasis on software development, productivity, and sustainability, as distinct from the "scientific" and mathematical aspects of computational science and engineering.
