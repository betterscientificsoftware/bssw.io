### What Are Strategies for More Effective Teams?

<!--deck start--->
While teams of all sizes can be found across CSE research areas, small teams are becoming more and more prevalent. It, thus, becomes essential to understand the dynamics of working with small teams and devise strategies to improve them.

Research in CSE is inherently collaborative, bringing together people whose combined skills span across mathematics, computer science, and domain areas of science and engineering.  

Perhaps most prevalent are small teams (for example, a professor and collaborating students and postdocs, or a modest sized research group).  Increasingly prevalent as CSE teams work toward next-generation challenges in predictive science are _aggregate teams_, composed of multiple successful previously existing teams, where software is a primary means of collaboration. Sometimes an aggregate team is known as a _team of teams_.   We provide information to help foster teamwork in teams of all sizes, leveraging people's diverse skills in pursuit of a common goal.
