Conferences and workshops play a pivotal role as forums for members of industry, academia, national laboratories, and other research organizations to exchange scientific computing research. 
These events offer researchers valuable opportunities to showcase their latest findings, discuss and exchange ideas with other experts, and cultivate collaborations that drive innovation in their field. 
Beyond knowledge-sharing and collaboration, attending conferences and workshops helps researchers to learn about new funding and grant opportunities, and to remain up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements in their field, enabling them to refine their research approach, resulting in the development of new insights, techniques, and approaches that can further advance their research agenda. 
The scientific computing field spans various domains, and conferences and workshops offer researchers a chance to connect with experts from other domains and fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. 
With both formal and informal settings, conferences/workshops are considered good environments to build deeper, meaningful relationships with one's colleagues and community.

Attending conferences and workshops can also provide significant networking and career advancement opportunities. 
Employers in scientific computing often use these events to recruit talented people who possess sought-after skills, interests, knowledge, and/or abilities. 
Additionally, these venues offer an opportunity for organizations to promote and highlight their mission, values, and projects. 
Through poster and panel sessions, new researchers can showcase their work, gain recognition for their research, and raise their profile in their field.

Volunteering to be part of a conference organizing committee is useful for established researchers because it allows them to contribute to the advancement of their field by shaping the content, format, and focus of these events, as well as mentoring and supporting newer researchers and emerging talent/scholars.

The scientific computing community offers several high-profile conferences and workshops that are held both domestically in the United States and internationally.
