Software libraries have demonstrated their efficacy in delivering extensively reusable software characterized by robustness, efficiency, and scalability, particularly in the realm of high-performance computing. Interoperability among software libraries pertains to the seamless utilization of two or more libraries within an application code, requiring no additional effort from the user.

In the expanding landscape of computational science, multiscale and multiphysics modeling, simulation, and analysis have become increasingly important for tackling complex scientific and engineering challenges. In response to the complex nature of these problems, the collaborative utilization of software developed by independent groups has become imperative. No single team possesses the exhaustive resources required to cover the entire spectrum of capabilities necessary for predictive science and decision support in such diverse and intricate domains. This collaborative approach allows researchers to harness the collective expertise and specialized focus of various teams, combining their strengths to address multifaceted challenges comprehensively. In this context, interoperable software libraries play a crucial role in facilitating  collaboration and integration of software from different sources. 

The article *[Understanding Interoperable Software Libraries](/blog_posts/understanding-interoperable-software-libraries)* discusses software library interoperability, or the ability of two or more libraries to be used together in an application code, without special effort on the part of the user, in greater depth.
