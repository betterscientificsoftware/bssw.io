Good documentation plays an important role during the software development lifecycle, from planning through the development and maintenance phases. Having reliable documentation helps to convey where to and how to use the software, its range of validity, and its technical details. Good documentation records knowledge during different stages of the development cycle and eases the transfer of knowledge when team dynamics and personnel change over time. 

This [WhatIs doc](https://ideas-productivity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IDEAS-DocumentationWhatIsGoodDocumentation-V0.1.pdf "What is Good Documentation?") provides guidelines for what constitutes good documentation for CSE software.
