CSE software development processes vary depending on project complexity, scale and needs - the recommended requirements usually advocated through known and widely used best practices address most demanding project needs; but others should and can adopt a subset of these practices depending upon their needs.

All software development should be cognizant of quality control, and should ideally adopt software practices that lead to reproducible results.  Beyond that, the rigor and extent of software practices adopted should reflect the scope and complexity of the project. 

In scientific software requirements gathering phase only loosely determines the required functionality to achieve project goals  because scientific software typically does not have static goals. They change with greater knowledge and understanding, therefore, in  a way requirements gathering can be viewed as an ongoing process in scientific codes. Not only must the software design be flexible enough to accommodate this dynamism, the software process must also be able to handle it. Development process also involves determination and articulation of verification and validation standards, coding standards and documentation standards. It also includes decision on whether automated regular testing should be a part of the development regime, and if so what are the policites for checking in and addressing testsuite failures.  Having well defined coding and testing standards from the outset is essential.  Documentation  standards dictate the extent of information carried about the development process.  For example, a policy could be that all interfaces  be  described  in  terms  of  functionality, parameters,  and outcomes  in  terms  of  both  returned  quantities  and  any  changes  to  the  state, and how much documentation should be maintained about design choices and references  relevant  to  the code.  A  part  of  coding  standard  could  be  the  choice  of  variable names,  which  would ideally  be  as  self-explanatory  as  possible.
