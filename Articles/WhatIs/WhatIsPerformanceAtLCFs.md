The Department of Energy (DOE) Leadership Computing Facilities (LCF) represent an array of advanced computing resources dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific research. Tailored to support large-scale simulations across various disciplines such as physics, chemistry, climate science, and materials science, these facilities operate within numerous national laboratories and research centers. Housing some of the world's most powerful supercomputers, the primary objective is to provide researchers with computational power essential for addressing intricate problems and conducting simulations impractical on conventional systems. Prominent DOE Leadership Computing Facilities include Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).

The BSSw.io topic of *Performance at Leadership Computing Facilities* delves into the cutting-edge domain of HPC and its profound impact on scientific research. This category encapsulates resources and articles reflecting the experiences, challenges, and solutions encountered by researchers utilizing LCF to design, implement, and run software on current supercomputers, while also exploring emerging supercomputers of the next generation. Furthermore, it sheds light on collaborative experiences within the scientific community, featuring training events that empower researchers to maximize the potential of these advanced computing resources.
