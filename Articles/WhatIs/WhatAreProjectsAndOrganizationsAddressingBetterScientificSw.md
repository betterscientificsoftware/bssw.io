### What Are Projects and Organizations Addressing Better Scientific Software?

The topic of *Better Scientific Software* focusses on how to improve software development and software sustainability, along with improving developer productivity - Are there projects and organizations addressing better scientific software?

With the growing recognition of the importance of software in the context of computational science and engineering (CSE), a variety of organizations and projects are springing up with the goal of supporting and enhancing the software aspect of CSE research and development.  These are distinct from funding organizations and programs that support better scientific software, which are covered under a [separate topic](WhatAreFundingSourcesAndProgramsAddressingBetterScientificSw.md) on this site.  However, some of the projects described under this topic may be funded through those programs.
