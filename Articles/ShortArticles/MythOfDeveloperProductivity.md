# Myth of Developer Productivity

<!--deck text start-->
The ability to directly effectively measure individual software developer productivity has eluded software developers for decades.  Why is this so hard and what are the alternatives?

Here are the references I want to include: [myth-dev-prod], [cant-meas-prod], [kanban-and-scrum], [impl-lean-dev] (NOTE: We need a CC article for [impl-lean-dev].)

Key points to make?

* Why we care to measure productivity? => Software estimation, individual developer performance evaluation?

* The number one way of improving productivity is to write less software (see [impl-lean-dev]).

* The cost of software maintenance is often several times much higher than the cost to create the software in the first place.

* The on-going cost of software maintenance is strongly correlated with the size of the code base (see: code complete???).

* Defining productivity by directly measuring the amount of software created disincentivizes solutions that may reuse existing software or refactorings that may actaully result in less overall source code.

* Cover some of the arguments made in the comments of https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/issues/1341
