through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project an inclusive experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion,

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to edit, remove or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not consistent with this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of
Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently
applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.
