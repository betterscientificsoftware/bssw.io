# test_004_pass.md

This file will actually PASS the acceptance check even though the meta-data section
exists but the comment wasn't opened properly.  The website wouldn't find the 'Publish: yes'
tag and thus shouldn't actually publish this.  It's effecitvely the same as a file with no
metadata section
