# test_004_pass

This test document will 'pass' the acceptance test because there is no 'metadata' section at all.

Since only documents that (1) have a metadata section, and (2) contain a 'Publish: yes' entry in
that metadata will get pushed up to the website, we don't want to reject documents that have no
metadata in them since they might be works-in-progress.
