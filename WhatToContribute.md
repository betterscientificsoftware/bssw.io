### What to Contribute: Content for Better Scientific Software

#### Background

The [betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) repository is for collaborative content development on general topics related to [developer productivity](Articles/WhatIsProductivity.md) and [software sustainability](Articles/WhatIsSustainability.md).  

#### Content Categories

Content categories can include:
- **"What Is" document:** A document that defines terms and concepts in a particular topic area.  For example, the article could describe terms and concepts related to automated testing.  This kind of document is often helpful as background for "How To" documents that describe testing processes.
- **"How To" document:** A document that describes a process for improving producitivity and sustainability.
- **Original experience:** An original article (brevity is appreciated) for informing the computational science and engineering (CSE) community about how to improve developer productivity and software sustainability.
- **Curated links:** A brief article that highlights other web-based articles or content.  Your article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content.

#### Content Scope

The exact scope of relevant content will evolve as we learn about community interests.  However, presently we believe the following guidelines should be useful:
#### In-scope Content
- General productivity and sustainability that overlaps with common challenges faced in the CSE software community.
- General tools for productivity and sustainability that can be widely used by CSE developers.
- Characterization of challenges and solutions that may be particularly valuable to the CSE community.

#### Highlight Connections to CSE
- How your topic intersects with themes that are of particular interest to CSE, for example MPI, Fortran, C++, architectures, modeling and simulation.
- Why your topic could be of particular interest to CSE.

#### Ease of Adoption and Use
- Address how easy or hard it is to benefit from your topic.
- Address who would be particularly interested in the topic.

#### Out-of-scope Content
- Narrow scope, focused on a particular CSE subcommunity.
- Tools, processes and practices that have little in common with CSE.
- Content that is deemed incomplete or biased, as determined by the BSSW leaders.
