I don't know about everyone else in the HPC/CSE community but I use my web browser just about every day for many things.
I do work on GitHub, interact with ChatGPT and find and read documentation just to name a few reasons I use a web browser.

In this video, Andreas Kling gives a brief overview of the browser business and introduces the [LadyBird](https://ladybird.org) browser; a non-profit driven effort to develop, from scratch, a wholly new, C++ based web browser.

I was stunned to learn that all widely and currently available web browsers trace their funding and/or code bases back to the 35 million lines of code comprising Google Chrome.

Andreas touches on many aspects of LadyBird software development relevant to the HPC/CSE community including such things as growing a small project and attracting sponsors, demonstrating performance and functionality against industry standard tests and addressing the long tail of corner cases and compliance issues essential to supplanting existing competitors.

In addition to the very interesting and relevant software development story of LadyBird, our HPC/CSE community may find a new, independently developed and unencumbered by commercial interests browser a useful tool to have for our own daily software development activity.
Some may even find it worthwhile to [help with development](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird).
