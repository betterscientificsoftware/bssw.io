I don't know about everyone else in the HPC/CSE community, but I use my web browser just about every day for many things.
I do work on GitHub, interact with ChatGPT, and find and read documentation just to name a few reasons I use a web browser.

Andreas Kling developed on browsers for several major companies within the tech industry for 15+ years.
In this video, he gives a brief overview of the browser business and introduces the [LadyBird](https://ladybird.org) browser - a non-profit driven effort to develop, from scratch, a wholly new, C++ based web browser.

Did you know that all widely and currently available web browsers trace a majority of their funding and code base back to Google and the Chrome browser?
While Chrome is 35+ million lines of code, LadyBird is less than half a million and passes the [Acid3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3) test.

In the video, Andreas touches on many aspects of LadyBird software development including topics that resonate with the HPC/CSE community.
These includes such things as growing a small project and attracting sponsors, demonstrating performance and functionality against industry standard tests and addressing the long tail of corner cases and compliance issues essential to supplanting older technologies.

In addition to the very interesting and relevant software development story of LadyBird, our HPC/CSE community may find a new, independently developed and unencumbered-by-commercial-interests browser a useful tool to have for our own daily software development activities.
Some may even find it worthwhile to [help with development](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird).
