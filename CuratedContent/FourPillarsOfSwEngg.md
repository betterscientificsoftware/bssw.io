Research Software Engineering (RSE) has grown to be a 
 high quality research software development is important.
 For researchers building software, it relies on seeing
software development as a realistic focus for a research career.

 In this article we introduce “4 pillars” of Research Software
Engineering that we see as providing the necessary elements to offer
comprehensive, ongoing support for the development of quality research
software. 

 We show
that these areas include extensive professional software development
practitioner knowledge that is now more likely to be recognised as important and necessary in the development of robust research software,.
 These 4 pillars are similar to the
elements of social change models that focus on individual, organisation,
community, and policy levels.

Four pillars are: software development, community, training and policy
* Maintainability, sustainability and robustness are core aspects of
building quality software that form part of our first pillar – Software
Development.

* The need for communication, learning from the experiences of others, and keeping up with the latest developments provides the basis for
our second pillar – Community.

* The importance of ensuring initial and ongoing skills development
for people building research software underpins our third pillar – Training.

* Developing both institutional and national policies that recognise the
importance of research software provides the basis for the fourth pillar
– Policy

While all 4 pillars contribute to the cultural change required, changes
to policy frameworks can provide significant top-down impact to support
the other 3 pillars. Positioning policy within the framework is, therefore,
challenging since the other pillars can be seen as relying on, and
building on, policy. . We therefore include policy within our framework as
a pillar supporting the overall RSE space, alongside the other pillars.
