An interesting example from the article encourages projects to seek to develop various forms of
[*legitimate peripheral participation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation) for
newcomers. That is, simpler, lower risk tasks that nonetheless contribute to and further the
goals of the overall project. Another interesting tip is to tag issues with a
recogniziable label to indicate they are good for newcomers and also to ensure
veteran team members leave such issues alone (e.g. don't go fixing them :smile:).

A key aspect to *sustainability* is to build a community; not just *users* of the software but also
advocates, mentors, developers, maintainers and even project leaders. The article is about a
15 minute read with many concrete suggestions and practices to start building your community.
