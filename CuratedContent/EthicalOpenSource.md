First, it has to be said that various [software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license) aiming to restrict the use of the source code in one way or another typically fail to meet one or more of the criteria necessary to be considered *open-source*.
Well known examples are [Server-Side Public License (SSPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License), [Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license), [Business Source License (BSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License) and [Microsoft Shared Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Source_Initiative#Restricted_licenses).

Nonetheless, because such licenses mean the source code is available for all to see, they are often confused with *open-source*.
A technically more accurate designation for this brand of license commonly used in the industry is *source-available*.
While source-available licensing is a relatively recent trend in the industry, some commonly recognized major projects utilize them including [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license), [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/) and [GitLab Enterprise Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software#GitLab_Enterprise_Edition_License_(EE_License)).

A new kind of source-available license based on ethical use considerations has begun to emerge as well.
This brand of licensing is referred to as [*ethical source*](https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/) and aims to restrict the use of software to ethical purposes.
Are developers of the software ok if it is used, for example, in creation of deepfake imagery or video, in human gene editing or cloning, in the blanket surveillance of whole populations of people, in a weapon of mass destruction?

Some recent and prominent examples of members of the open-source software community raising ethical concerns over the use of their software include [Elastic Search](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2024/elastics-journey-from-apache-2-0-to-agpl-3/), [TensorFlow](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) and [Dual_EC_DRBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG#Standardization_and_implementations).
By contrast, of the approximately 8,500 packages in [Spack](https://spack.io), only one uses an ethical-source license.

To put ethical-source licenses in perspective, it is worth considering how ethical use considerations have been applied to other technologies, such as cryptographic algorithms. 
These methods are fundamental to securing digital communication, protecting financial transactions, and ensuring data privacy. 
However, they can also be exploited for illicit activities such as ransomware, unauthorized data encryption, or circumventing security measures. 
End-to-end encryption, for example, is widely used in messaging apps to protect user privacy, while secure hashing algorithms help ensure data integrity and password security—applications generally considered ethical. 
Yet, like most cryptographic tools, they can also be misused for unauthorized activities, such as hiding malicious communications, facilitating fraud, or concealing digital footprints.

For those interested in considering using an “ethical source” license, the most useful part of the Wikipedia article curated here may be the long list of references illustrating the community’s dialog on the topic.
