Publication | Year 2021, Communications of the ACM, DOI: [10.1145/3459613](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3459613), [ACM Link](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/articles/252174-the-10-best-practices-for-remote-software-engineering/fulltext)

With a significant portion of the world working remotely during the year 2020-2021, efficient remote working and improving the productivity of remote workers has received a lot of attention. With a goal of improving individual and team productivity, this article explores how to set efficient goals and to improve remote communication skills, time management, and task management. In the article, *The 10 Best Practices for Remote Software Engineering*, which was published in Communications of the ACM in May 2021, the author contends that productivity is perhaps a quality that is not easily measurable by tools and techniques but is rather based on human behaviour and emotions that are derived and manifested from underlying levels of happiness.

The article was a compelling read because many times we undermine, forget or ignore how the happiness factor influences our overall work life as well as individual and team productivity.

The paper summarizes the following 10 suggested best practices that can improve a remote developer's happiness:
* Work on things that you care about;
* Define goals for yourself;
* Define productivity for yourself;
* Establish routine and environment;
* Take responsibility for your work;
* Take responsibility for human connection;
* Practice empathetic review;
* Have self-compassion;
* Learn to say yes, no, and not anymore; and
* Choose correct communication channels

Following some of these practices may lead to increased happiness and therefore increased productivity for individuals and teams.
