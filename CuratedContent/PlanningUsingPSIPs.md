# Planning for Better Software: [PSIP-Tools](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools)

Scientific software teams are typically focused on the creation of a new set of features that will enable the next set of computational experiments.  Teams seldom have the time to stop development and focus solely on improving productivity or sustainability.  However, teams can incorporate improvements *on the way* to developing new science capabilities.

The Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) process recognizes that productivity and sustainability improvements for scientific software benefit from an incremental, iterative approach.  The [PSIP-Tools GitHub repo](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools) is a collection of documents that enable the adoption and use of PSIP for a software team.  The PSIP-Tools repo contains everything from a template for the first introduction letter to a complete interview guide, interview prompts and expected timeline.

The PSIP process has been successfully used to help scientific software teams acheive incremental, sustainable process improvement, while still achieving their science goals.
