Reminders to eat your vegetables and exercise daily may not always be appreciated, but nonetheless remain good advice. This article *How to Write a Git Commit Message* fits the bill on what one should be doing with Git commits.

The piece employs a humorous cartoon to illustrate how messages can devolve into gibberish during extended work sessions. It then delves into the crux of the matter, stressing the significance of clear and concise Git commit messages. The article introduces seven rules, advocating for practices such as separating subject and body, limiting the subject line to 50 characters, and using the imperative mood. Emphasizing the impact on collaboration and project maintainability, it urges developers to establish commit message conventions. The article concludes by endorsing command line usage for Git operations and recommending the Pro Git book for in-depth understanding. Balancing seriousness with humor, this 2014 piece remains a relevant reminder for developers striving to enhance their commit practices.
