This [interview podcast](https://exascaleproject.org/method-enables-collaborative-software-teams-to-enhance-effectiveness-and-efficiency/ "PSIP for ECP") of [Elaine Raybourn](https://github.com/elaineraybourn "Elaine Raybourn Profile") from the [ECP IDEAS](https://ideas-productivity.org) team gives an excellent insight on how the Productivity Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) software improvement process is beneficial for Exascale Computing Project (ECP) software and application teams.

Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) is a lightweight, iterative workflow that allows software development teams to identify development bottlenecks and track progress to overcome them. 

The ECP project has over 1000 researchers and over 100 teams. Focussing on how to improve software sustainability and team productivity, PSIP brings software development activities together and enables partnerships and the adoption of best practices across aggregate teams.

Discover the impetus behind PSIPs, how to incorporate PSIPs into your research project and success stories about teams that have jumped on the PSIP bandwagon, through this podcast!
