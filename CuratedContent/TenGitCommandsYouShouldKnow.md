The distributed source management tool Git can be complicated to learn and use, especially for software developers who started with CVS or SVN or similar tools where there was always an official central repository.  I tend to use GitHub and have found the GitHub desktop client to be very useful.  It does 99% of what I need.  However there are times when I am working on the command line, or need to do something beyond what the desktop client can do.  

The article [10 Git Commands You Should Know: Plus tips to save time with Git](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-git-commands-you-should-know-df54bea1595c) by [Jeff Hale](https://towardsdatascience.com/@jeffhale) provides a nice overview of some of the most useful git commands, including a brief handholding session for leading you through the essential vim (a powerful but cryptic editor) commands needed to successfully complete a git commit.
