This article explains why cleaning work area surfaces regularly is important. It reminds us
of all the different surfaces we routinely touch in our work areas over the course of a day
and provides useful information on how often to clean surfaces and the types of cleaners that
are useful. The article also explains why measures such these, which are often seen as so *small* that they
are easily overlooked, help contribute to *flattening the curve*. The article includes over
30 references, many authoritative, of relevance to current health concerns.
