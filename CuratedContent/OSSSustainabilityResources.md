Sustaining a scientific software project is a difficult task.  One
strategy for sustaining scientific software is to build a community of
open source contributors.  

This page documents resources available for maintainers of open source
software (OSS), from reports and books discussing the problems facing OSS
maintainers, to foundations and nonprofits that can potentially provide
community funding for open source projects.  Much scientific software is
open source, and the needs of mainstream open source projects frequently
overlap with those of the scientific community.  Better Scientific
Software encourages leveraging the wisdom of existing successful projects
to implement your sustainability plan.
