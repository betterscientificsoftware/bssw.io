# Sustaining Open Source Software

Sustaining a scientific software project is a difficult task.  One
strategy for sustaining scientific software is to build a community of
open source contributors.  Building a community can be daunting, and if
you are successful, the work involved in sustaining the community can
come to dominate your time.

This page documents resources available for maintainers of open source
software, from reports and books discussing the problems facing OSS
maintainers, to foundations and non-profits that can potentially provide
community funding for open source projects.  Much scientific software is
open source, and the needs of mainstream open source projects frequently
overlap with those of the scientific community.  Better Scientific
Software encourages leveraging the wisdom of existing successful projects
to implement your sustainability plan.


## Reports and books on open source software

* Nadia Eghbal. [Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/). Ford Foundation Report. 2016.

  Ford Foundation report on long-term sustainability of open source
  software infrastructure.

* Open Source Guides, by GitHub: [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/)

  A series of how-tos on launching and sustaining open source
  projects. From starting a project, licensing, maintaining, establishing
  community governance, and finding funding.

* Karl Fogel. [Producing Open Source Software](https://www.amazon.com/Producing-Open-Source-Software-Successful/dp/0596007590/). 2005.

  This book is soon to be
  [updated to a second edition](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kfogel/updating-producing-open-source-software-for-2nd-ed).
  It breaks down the process of managing a community of open source
  developers.

## Podcasts

* [Request for Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc)

  A podcast about the human aspects of software development, focusing on
  software sustainability. Many interviews with leaders in major open
  source projects.

* [RCE Podcast](http://www.rce-cast.com/)

  A podcast that covers open source projects in HPC. Many interviews with
  maintainers, researchers, and developers of popular HPC software
  projects. Run by Brock Palen (UMich) and Jeff Sqyres (Cisco).

## Foundations and non-profits that fund open source development

* [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/): 501 (c) non-profit sustaining
  open source projects in data science.

* [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) The Linux
  Foundation is a non-profit technology trade association chartered to
  promote, protect and advance Linux and collaborative development.

  * [OpenHPC](openhpc.community) is a member project.


## Grants

* The [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov) offers
  funding for
  [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16532/nsf16532.htm)
  and has frequent calls for proposals.

* The [DOE](https://energy.gov/) and other agencies work with the US
  [SBIR Program](https://www.sbir.gov/) to help small businesses conduct
  R&D. Starting a company to apply for SBIR funding is a potential way to
  productize and sustain an open source project started on research
  funds.  See the [ASCR SBIR page](https://science.energy.gov/sbir/) to
  get started.

* The [Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) and the
  [Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/) offer grants in science and
  technology, among other areas. They have funded large data science
  initiatives that support open source, such as the
  [Moore-Sloan Data Sciecne Environments (MSDE)](http://msdse.org/) and
  the
  [Jupyter Project](https://blog.jupyter.org/2015/07/07/jupyter-funding-2015/).

* The [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org) has
  [grants](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/our-grants/) dedicated to
  fighting inequality. One thrust area is
  [technology for the public interest](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/challenging-inequality/),
  which funded the Roads & Bridges report on open source.
