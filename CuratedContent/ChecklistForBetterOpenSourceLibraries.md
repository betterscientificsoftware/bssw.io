The article *[How to open source your Python library](https://opensource.com/article/18/12/tips-open-sourcing-python-libraries)* by [Moshe Zadka](https://opensource.com/users/moshez) presents a useful checklist advising developers of what they should do when providing an open source Python library to the broader community.  Advice covers a broad spectrum of concerns, including source management, testing, documentation and versioning, plus useful links to tools and concepts mentioned in the article.  

While targeted specifically at Python libraries, recommendations are relevant to other languages.  Tools mentioned are either applicable to other languages, or similar tools exist.  We think anyone interested in providing open source software could find valuable advice.
