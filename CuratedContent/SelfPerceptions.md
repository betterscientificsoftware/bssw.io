Researchers and scientists are now spending increasing amounts of
time developing software. But how many of them are actually using
software engineering practices that can help them write better software?

Paper title  | Self-Perceptions about Software Engineering: A Survey of Scientists and Engineers
Authors | Jeffrey Carver, Dustin Heaton, Lorin Hochstein, and Roscoe Bartlett
Publication | Year 2013, Computing in Science and Engineering - Vol 15, DOI: [10.1109/MCSE.2013.12](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/2013/01/mcs2013010007/13rRUx0xPqU)

The journal article *Self-Perceptions about Software Engineering:
A Survey of Scientists and Engineers*---a survey paper published
in 2013---made observations that continue to be very relevant
for the scientific software community even today. The article recognizes
that scientists and engineers must often double as part-time software
developers, with activities ranging from writing small-scale scripts
for their research to highly complex code that will be used on high-performance
computers. While software development skills
are becoming as integral to science and engineering as laboratory
skills, the community hasn't yet developed a culture of training for
the relevant software skills.

The paper surveys close to 150 researchers, encompassing people
from a rich educational background (with 82% respondents having a
Ph.D.) from the domains of mathematics and statistics, engineering, and 
computer science. The survey
analyzes how respondents spent their time, whether
developing research software, production software or focusing
on both types. The survey covers a broad spectrum of software
engineering practices such as version control, documentation,
verification and validation, testing, design requirements, issue
and bug tracking, code reviews, acceptance testing, agile methods,
and refactoring, all of which should be of prime importance in
any software development environment. All these factors make this
survey paper an interesting and fun read for folks working in scientific
software development community.
