# A look at the economic forces in Open Source Software

The Slate Article *The Internet Was Built on the Free Labor of Open Source Developers. Is That Sustainable?* looks at the economics driving the Open Source movement and how that is putting those utilizing that software without investing in it at risk.

Focus | A look at the complicated business of funding open source software development.

Much of modern HPC software is underpinned by Open Source - be that the Linux kernel or Tensorflow, SuperLU, or others. Yet treating the availability of that software as an extrernality means taking on the risk that said software has flaws that may impair your own work.

Daniel Oberhaus explores the problems in this model using the now infamous "Heartbleed Bug" tracing it's introduction into openSSL through to the final discovery and fix. Along the way he looks at the cost estimates for dealing with the bug ([~500Million](https://www.eweek.com/security/heartbleed-ssl-flaw-s-true-cost-will-take-time-to-tally)) and compares that to the development budget for openSSL at the time ($2000/year). Noting that a lot of the drivers in Open Source development are not monetary, he traces a series of actions from directly tasking employees to work on projects to paying for support contracts. These actions can help assure the codes they iuse are robust and reliable.
