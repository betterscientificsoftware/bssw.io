# Jenkins Continuous Integration

As discussed in ["What Is CSE Software Testing?"](WhatIsCseSwTesting.md), automatic testing systems lower the burden of running software tests and adding new tests.  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/ "Jenkins Homepage") is an open-source automation server that provides plugins to support building, deploying, and automating software projects. Jenkins can monitor the execution of repeated jobs, such as building/testing software projects continuously and monitoring execution of externally run jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
