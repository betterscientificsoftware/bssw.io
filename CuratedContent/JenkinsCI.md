Automatic testing systems lower the burden of running software tests and adding new tests. *[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/ "Jenkins Homepage")* is an open-source automation server that provides plugins to support building, deploying, and automating software projects. *Jenkins* can monitor the execution of repeated jobs, such as building/testing software projects continuously and monitoring execution of externally run jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
