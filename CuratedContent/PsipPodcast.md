# What Makes PSIP Suitable for the Exascale Computing Project?

<!-- deck text start -->
The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) focuses on the development of a highly capable exascale ecosystem. With hundreds of people and many code projects of varying sizes involved in ECP, what is the path for continued improvements to software sustainability and quality both within and across ensembles of interdependent codes and teams?

This *[interview podcast](https://exascaleproject.org/method-enables-collaborative-software-teams-to-enhance-effectiveness-and-efficiency/ "PSIP for ECP")* featuring [Elaine Raybourn](https://github.com/elaineraybourn "Elaine Raybourn Profile") from the [IDEAS-ECP](https://ideas-productivity.org) team gives an excellent overview of the *[Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP)](https://bssw.io/psip)* process and explains how it is beneficial for [ECP](https://exascaleproject.org) software and application teams.

Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) is a lightweight, iterative workflow that allows software development teams to identify development bottlenecks and track progress to overcome them. 

The ECP project has over 1,000 researchers and over 100 software project teams. Focusing on how to improve software sustainability and team productivity, PSIP brings software development activities together and enables partnerships and the adoption of best practices across aggregate teams.

Through this podcast, discover the motivations behind PSIP, how to incorporate PSIP into your research project, and success stories about teams that have incorporated PSIP into their routine development processes.
