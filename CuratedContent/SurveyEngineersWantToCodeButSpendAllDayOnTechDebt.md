# Survey: Engineers Want to Code, but Spend Much of the Week on Tech Debt

<!--deck text start-->

Chainguard’s *2026 Engineering Reality Report* highlights a familiar challenge: engineers find building new features energizing, but day-to-day work is dominated by maintenance, technical debt, and tool friction.

Software teams in scientific computing often live with a tension between creating new capabilities and keeping complex systems reliable, secure, and reproducible. Chainguard’s *2026 Engineering Reality Report* puts numbers behind that tension based on 1,200 responses (600 software engineers and 600 senior technology leaders) collected in August 2025. The report’s headline is stark: while 93% of engineers say writing code and building new features is rewarding, respondents report spending only about 16% of their week on that kind of work. Instead, engineers report being pulled toward maintenance, upgrades, patching, vulnerability remediation, and other “toil” that can feel disconnected from mission value.

The report also underscores how tech debt and fragmented toolchains amplify the problem. Two-thirds of respondents say they frequently encounter technical debt that impacts their ability to deliver effectively, and 72% of engineers say competing demands make it difficult to find space for building new features. Tool sprawl is another recurring theme: engineers report using many tools each week, and most say that switching between tools harms productivity (including a large fraction reporting a significant loss of focus).

The New Stack’s companion summary, *Survey: Engineers Want To Code, But Spend All Day on Tech Debt*, is a helpful entry point for readers who want a narrative overview and additional context around burnout and retention concerns. For leaders of research software projects, this framing matters: sustained delivery requires not just talented people, but also an environment that protects time for high-value work.

Both pieces point to practical levers that translate well to the scientific software ecosystem:

* Treat “maintenance work” as planned, funded project work (dependency upgrades, security patching, CI reliability, documentation) rather than ad hoc interruptions.
* Reduce context switching by simplifying and integrating toolchains where possible, and by standardizing workflows that new team members can adopt quickly.
* Use automation and (carefully governed) AI to reclaim time from repetitive tasks; the report associates higher automation with engineers spending more time on work that energizes them.
* Make technical debt visible and actionable: define what “debt” means for the project, track it, and routinely budget time to pay it down.

For BSSw.io readers, the value of these resources is less about any single statistic and more about the consistent signal: engineering organizations (including those building research software) should intentionally design their processes and tooling to minimize toil, so that teams can spend more time on the creative, mission-driven work that motivates them.
