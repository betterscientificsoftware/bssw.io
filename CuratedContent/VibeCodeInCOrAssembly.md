# If You’re Going to Vibe Code, Why Not Do It in C?

<!--deck text start-->

Stephen Ramsay's blog post *If You’re Going to Vibe Code, Why Not Do It in C?* raises the point that
if we're all vibe coding now, it might not matter what language is generated by the AI.

"*Programming languages are for humans, not computers*" is a fact that is easy to forget when you
spend a lot of time writing in one of those languges in order to get a computer do to something
interesting or solve a problem.  Over the history of computing we (humans) have created quite a few
languages for programming computers, generally moving in the direction away from the machine
language computers natively work in, towards a language that is easier for humans to understand and
be effective in.

Now with AI models allowing us to Vibe Code by writing in our native spoken language and the AI
generates the results of our requests in a programming language, Stephen Ramsay's blog post above
asks the question: "*Why vibe code with a language that has human convenience and ergonomics in
view?*", why not have the AI write in C, or for that matter machine language?  Or maybe we want to
come up with a "Vibe-Oriented Programming language" (VOP) that makes it easier for us to express
ideas to the AI as opposed to a compiler?

It's a couple of interesting ideas, not without some controversy (that Ramsay addresses in the
article) and are perhaps even more surprising and obvious as the first observation here that programming
languages are for humans.
