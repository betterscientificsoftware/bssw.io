A *[Methods and Tools Editor Blog](http://blog.martinig.ch/)* is maintained by the editor of the *Methods and Tools software development magazine*. The reader will discover that most of the blog postings are short lists of links that were considered interesting (usually headlined "Software Development Linkopedia") and pointers to conferences and workshops ("Software Development Conferences Forecast"). There are occasionally other types of posts, as well.  The content is for the general software development community, and is *not* in any way focused on CSE, but some of the material may nevertheless be interesting and useful to CSE software developers.
