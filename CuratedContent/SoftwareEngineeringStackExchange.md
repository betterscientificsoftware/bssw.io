Resource name | Software Engineering Stack Exchange
Website | https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/
Focus | Software development and engineering

The focus of this particular Stack Exchange site is on software engineering; computational science and engineering or high-performance computing specifically do not figure prominently in the content here.  If you want to ask about software engineering questions you've encountered in your CSE or HPC work, recognize that different user communities have different experiences with software engineering tools and practices.  They often benefit from "tailoring" to make them more usable and useful to our community.
