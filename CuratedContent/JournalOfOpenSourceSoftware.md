# Journal of Open Source Software

[Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](http://joss.theoj.org) provides authors with a DOE for their software package without requiring a full-length manuscript. Instead, authors must demonstrate (via a form of peer review) that their package follows certain best practices of open-source software, including proper licensing and documentation, and helps meet scientific research challenges.

 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
   Like JOSS, Zenodo can provide a DOI for your software.
   Unlike JOSS, it does not require a review of the software,
   and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub
   integration.
   Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their
   data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others
   to access that data.
