Following are some resources for a Transmedia Learning Framework for Git and GitHub, with emphasis on use for computational science and high-performance computing. 

- *[Udacity MOOC How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)*
-This free Udacity massively open online course (MOOC) focuses on revision control for code using Git and GitHub.

- *[Git tutorial 2: Advanced Techniques with Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF9X62rLSjE)*
-This tutorial covers advanced git commands including fetching, cloning, remotes, branches, merging, forking and stashing.

- *[IDEAS Productivity Intermediate Git Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBNlcq2B2E8)*
-Roscoe Bartlett, Sandia National Laboratories, discusses intermediate-level tutorial and reference information about the Git revision control system. This overview takes the view that the best way to learn to use Git effectively is to learn it as a data structure and a set of algorithms to manipulate that data structure.  

- *[A Tutorial and Reference Collection for Git](/items/a-tutorial-and-reference-collection-for-git)*
-This page provides links to some useful tutorial and reference information about the git revision control system.

- [GitGame](https://www.git-game.com/)
-The git-game is a terminal based game that teaches both new and advances users some pretty cool features of the git scm (source control management) system. The theme of the game is a scavenger hunt. Using git's commands you find clues that will help you solve the "puzzle".
