The  *[All In for Maintainers](https://allinopensource.org/maintainers/)*  initiative strives to provide maintainers with the necessary resources and assistance to promote diversity and inclusivity in open source communities. The initiative's inaugural resource, the *[All In for Maintainers DEI Resource Hub](https://allinopensource.org/maintainers/DEI-resources/)*, has been meticulously crafted by maintainers themselves, making it uniquely tailored to their needs.     


Maintainers, much like team leaders in the open-source world, have a significant impact on these communities. They shape the atmosphere of inclusion and determine whether people feel embraced or excluded in a project. This effort acknowledges the crucial role maintainers hold and is committed to strengthening their ability to support diversity, fairness, and inclusiveness (DEI).

One of the key challenges identified during the *Maintainers Listening Tour* conducted in 2021 was maintainers' struggle to navigate the vast landscape of DEI resources. Many felt overwhelmed by the abundance of available materials and were unsure of where to start or who to turn to for guidance. To address this, the community came together to create the  All In for Maintainers DEI Resource Hubâ€”a comprehensive repository aggregating DEI resources in one accessible location. This hub covers a wide range of topics, including inclusive leadership, accessibility, well-being, and contributing to DEI in open source. Importantly, this site is designed to remain dynamic and continually updated to align with the evolving needs of maintainers and the changing demographics of software development.

The DEI Resource Hub serves as an entry point for maintainers to access essential resources, ensuring their communities remain inclusive and welcoming to all. If this topic interests you, stay updated on the DEI Resource Hub and forthcoming launches within the All In for Maintainers program as the community collectively works to foster a more diverse and inclusive open source ecosystem.
