# Multiphysics Simulations: Challenges and Opportunities

## Keyes, D.E., McInnes, L.C., Woodward, C., Gropp, W.D., Myra, E., Pernice, M., et al. (2013). doi:[10.1177/1094342012468181](https://doi.org/10.1177/1094342012468181)

This paper discusses multiphysics applications from algorithmic and architectural perspectives, where ‘‘algorithmic’’ includes both mathematical analysis and computational complexity, and ‘‘architectural’’ includes both software and hardware environments. 

Of particular interest in the BSSw context is section 4 (Multiphysics Software), which considers software issues from the perspective of scientific application teams, who face daunting challenges both in building application-specific infrastructure and in incorporating libraries, frameworks, and tools.  The section also discusses challenges in designing multiphysics software for HPC environments, possible approaches to help manage complexity and change, and practical difficulties in collaborative research software.
