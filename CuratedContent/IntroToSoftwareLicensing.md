This [tutorial](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4696285) on "An Introduction to Software Licensing" provides a brief introduction to software copyright and licensing for researchers in computational science and engineering.  It explains the difference between closed and open source software, and copyleft and permissive open source licenses.  It also outlines a variety of factors researchers might want to consider when selecting a software license.  It provides links to some key web resources as a starting point for deeper exploration.
