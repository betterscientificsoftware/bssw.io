*Read The Docs* is a free service for hosting documentation generated from tools such as
[Sphinx](DocumentationTools.Sphinx.md).  *Read The Docs* typically requires
documentation to be written in either reStructuredText or Markdown, and can be
configured to produce branch- or commit-specific documentation in a revision
control system (see [What Is Version Control?](WhatIsVersionControl.md)). <br> **NOTE: This URL is no longer valid**
