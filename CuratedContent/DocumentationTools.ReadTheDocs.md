# Read the Docs

[Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is a free service for hosting
documentation generated from tools such as
[Sphinx](DocumentationTools.Sphinx.md).  Read The Docs typically requires
documentation to be written in either reStructuredText or Markdown, and can be
configured to produce branch- or commit-specific documentation in a revision
control system (see [What Is Version Control?](WhatIsVersionControl.md)).
