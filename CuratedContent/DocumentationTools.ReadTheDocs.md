# Documentation Tools: Read the Docs

As mentioned in [Documentation Tools](DocumentationTools.md), documentation
establishes the contract the client abides by when interacting with software.

[Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is a free service for hosting
documentation generated from tools such as
[Sphinx](DocumentationTools.Sphinx.md).  Read The Docs typically requires
documentation to be written in either reStructuredText or Markdown, and can be
configured to produce branch- or commit-specific documentation in a version
control system (see [What Is Version Control?](WhatIsVersionControl.md), [How
to do Version Control with Git in your CSE
Project](HowToDoVersionControlWithGitInYourCseProject.md), and [Distributed
Version Control and Continuous Integration
Testing](DistributedVersionControlAndContinuousIntegrationTesting.md)).
