### Tutorial: CSE Collaboration through Software: Improving Productivity and Sustainability

**Venue:** Invited tutorial at [SIAM CSE17](https://www.siam.org/meetings/cse17/), Feb 28, 2017

**Presenters:**  David Bernholdt (ORNL), Anshu Dubey (ANL), Mike Heroux (SNL), Alicia Klinvex (SNL), Lois Curfman McInnes (ANL)

**Abstract:** CSE software—crosscutting technology that connects advances in mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering—is a foundation of sustained CSE collaboration and scientific progress. However, the need for increasingly broad functionality on ever more complex computer architectures creates daunting challenges for software development and sustainability.

This tutorial provides information on best practices in software engineering explicitly tailored for CSE. Goals are improving the productivity of those who develop CSE software and increasing the sustainability of software artifacts. We will discuss practices that are relevant for projects of all sizes, with emphasis on small teams (for example, a faculty member and collaborating students).  Topics are:

- _Why Effective Software Practices Are Essential for CSE Projects_
- _An Introduction to Software Licensing_
- _Better (Small) Scientific Software Teams_
- _Improving Reproducibility through Better Software Practices_
- _Testing of HPC Scientific Software_
