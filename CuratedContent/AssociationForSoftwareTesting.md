The *[Association for Software Testing (AST)](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/)* is an international non-profit professional association with members in over 50 countries. AST is dedicated and strives to build a testing community that views the role of testing as skilled, relevant, and essential to the production of faster, better, and less expensive software products. AST's goal is to follow a scientific approach to developing and evaluating techniques, processes, and tools, with a belief that a self-aware, self-critical attitude is essential to understanding and assessing the impact of new ideas on the practice of testing.
