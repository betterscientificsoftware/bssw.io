There is probably no other human endeavor that involves the volume of communication paired with creation of new *terminology* than software development. If one cares about their project's reach and wants to maximize their ability to attract and retain collaborators, developers, users, or sponsors, then they need to be mindful of the names and language they use. The language that one uses has the power to welcome others in, as well as push them away.

The *inclusive language movement* recognizes and has many examples and arguments supporting the fact that often terminology (in current use) either does a poor job of conveying purpose/meaning or is highly dependent on cultural context to interpret.

This article presents a growing list of inclusive language resources. Some of the resources here are concerned more with the *principles* of inclusive language whereas others are more concerned with the *practice* and, in particular, identifying some of the more egregious terms in current use (e.g. *master/slave*) and proposing suitable replacement terms.

<!-- That said, DevOps hardened tooling on par with linters, spelling or grammar checkers, is still in its infancy.

The resources here run the gamut from -->
