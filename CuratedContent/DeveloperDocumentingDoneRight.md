Developers often approach code documentation from different perspectives, ranging from its necessity to execution strategies and content updates. Instead of delving into specifics, the article advocates a broader view of developer documentation as a basis for deeper strategy discussions.

The article *Developer Documenting Done Right: Why, Who, What, Where, When and How * emphasizes the importance of understanding the "why" behind developer documentation, addressing its value and debunking common objections. It also highlights the significance of identifying "who" the audience for the documentation is. Encouraging readers to contemplate "what" to include in documentation, it suggests considerations like catering to new developers with walkthroughs, code patterns, explanations, and more. Storing documentation alongside code using version control is stressed for accessibility. The article touches on the "when" and "how" of documentation as well.

While code documentation is a valuable investment, the articles advises careful consideration of factors such as purpose, audience, and execution to formulate a good documentation plan.
