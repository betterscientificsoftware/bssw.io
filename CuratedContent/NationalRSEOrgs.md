Focus | Careers and Goals


High-quality software plays an important role in the progress of research in all scientific domains. The "Research Software Engineer (RSE)" designation was established to encourage and identify individuals dedicated to developing software within the research community. These individuals range from researchers to full-time programmers to software engineers â€” all of whom spend significant time in their careers designing software and writing scientific code. RSE is also emerging as a new career track in academia, labs, and industry, with a goal of distinguishing software engineers who work on non-research software vs. research software.

Since the inception of the RSE movement in 2014, several organizations and associations have emerged in Europe and in the USA, with a focus on research software engineers. The table above lists well-known organizations. The website of the UK RSE Association, one of the earliest established associations, contains much valuable information. With the establishment of the US RSE Association, efforts to build a strong RSE community are ramping up in the USA as well.
