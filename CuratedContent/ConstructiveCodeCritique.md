Peer code review has been shown to be beneficial to help developers identify and remove faults from code.  This article, from the UK Software Sustainabilty Institute (SSI) Collaborations Workshops 2017 Speed Blogging Series, provides advice for reviewing code.  

The authors address what to do before, during and after the review.  They also provide advice about how to introduce this well-established and valuable practice into scientific software communities, where the practice may not be well understood.
