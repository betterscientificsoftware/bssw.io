Adding tests of sufficient coverage and quality improves confidence in software and makes it easier to change and extend. Tests should be added to existing code before the code is changed. These tests then become the foundation of a regression test suite that helps effectively drive future development and improves long-term sustainability. This [HowTo doc](https://ideas-productivity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IDEAS-TestingHowtoAddImproveTestinginyourCSESoftwareProject-V0.2.pdf "How To Improve Testing for CSE Software") briefly explains how to add quality testing to a project to support adding a new feature/fixing a bug, improving the designand implementation, or optimizing resource usage
