Research in CSE is inherently collaborative, bringing together people whose combined skills span across mathematics, computer science, and domain areas of science and engineering. Increasingly prevalent, as CSE teams work toward next-generation challenges in predictive science, are aggregate teams, where software is a primary means of collaboration.

The *[presented material](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6151097)* formed the basis of the 90-minute break-out session presented at the DOE Exascale Computing Project Annual Meeting in 2018. It introduces the idea of developing shared consciousness, empowered execution, and enabling leadership among and within teams as important steps on the path toward scaling the productivity of small teams to a large networked aggregate team, or a team of teams based on ideas presented in the [2015 book by Stanley McChrystal, et al.](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486 "Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World") and other sources. This information has been provided to help foster teamwork in teams of all sizes, leveraging people's diverse skills in pursuit of a common goal.
