The minisymposium *Improving Productivity and Sustainability for Parallel Computing Software*, held at the [SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (PP20)](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/program/pp20), focused on technical, practical, and social challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability, with a goal of sharing insights in how to develop better and long-living, cutting-edge parallel computing software. 

A collection of talks presented at the [minisymposium](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=67772) can be found on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/collections/SIAM_PP20_Minisymposium_Improving_Productivity_and_Sustainability_for_Parallel_Computing_Software/4934688). The minisymposium featured several interesting presenters representing leadership computing facilities as well as various scientific projects. Below is a comprehensive list of the presenters and the covered topics.

* [Judith Hill](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/directory/staff-member/judith-hill/) spoke on the topic of software sustainability from the perspective off work at [Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/).
* [Sunita Chandrasekaran](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~schandra/) shared thoughts on training and best practices required to develop portable yet performant code.
* [Michal Habera](https://github.com/michalhabera) highlighted some of the top changes that have been carried out with respect to the sustainability of the [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org/).
* [Mark Gates](http://www.icl.utk.edu/~mgates3/) discussed sustainability lessons that have emerged from the [SLATE project](https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).
* [Anshu Dubey](https://www.anl.gov/profile/anshu-dubey) shared experiences with productivity and software sustainability, including work at the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/)
* [Benjamin Pritchard](http://molssi.org/molssi-software-scientist-dr-benjamin-pritchard/) focused on challenges and best practices in computational molecular sciences, with emphasis on the Molecular Sciences Software Institute ([MolSSI](https://molssi.org))
* [Kenneth Jansen](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/kenneth-jansen) shared software sustainability lessons from the fluid dynamics community, emphasizing work toward a Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure ([FDSI](https://www.colorado.edu/events/cfdsi/learn-more))
* David Moulton focused on productivity and sustainability in a community-driven software ecosystem for [watershed science](https://ideas-productivity.org/ideas-watersheds/)

Overall, the talks at the minisymposium provide good insight on challenges encountered and progress made toward software sustainability in various aspects of high-performance scientific computing.
