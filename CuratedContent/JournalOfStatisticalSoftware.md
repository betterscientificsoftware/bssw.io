# Journal of Statistical Software

[Journal of Statistical Software (JSS)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) is an established journal with a focus on software which implements statistical methods rather than other mathematical modeling topics.

<!---
 - [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) (Journal of Statistical Software):
   Like TOMS, but with a focus on software which implements statistical
   methods rather than other mathematical modeling topics.
 - [JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org) (The Journal of Open Source Software): This journal provides
   authors with a DOI for their software package without requiring a
   full-length manuscript.
   Instead, authors must demonstrate (via a form of peer review) that
   their package follows certain best practices of open-source software,
   including proper licensing and documentation,
   and helps meet scientific research challenges.
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
   Like JOSS, Zenodo can provide a DOI for your software.
   Unlike JOSS, it does not require a review of the software,
   and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub
   integration.
   Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their
   data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others
   to access that data.
