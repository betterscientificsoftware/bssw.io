# Resource Template

This is a template file to use as a starting point for a new resource for the Better Scientific Software site.  The comments section of this file includes guidelines on naming conventions and metadata, as provided in the [BSSw Style Guide](../StyleGuide.md).

While this template is appropriate for most new resources on the site, we also provide templates for aggregate resources, composed of an introduction to a topic and then multiple subresources (topical sections), contributed by potentially different authors.  For this case, see [ResourceTemplate.AggregateBase](ResourceTemplate.AggregateBase.md) and [ResourceTemplate.AggregateSubresource](ResourceTemplate.AggregateSubresource.md).

**To add a new resource using this file as a starting point:**
- View this file in Raw mode.
- Copy all text.
- Select `Create New File`.
- Paste text into your new document, as a starting point.  Then edit as you like.
- Continue following instructions in [How To Contribute](../HowToContribute.md).

To incorporate images, see the guidelines in the [Better Scientific Software images repository](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images/blob/master/README.md).

Please follow these guidelines for naming resources and files. Be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSSW site.

Resource Name:

    Brief, essential words only, nothing extra
    For curated content: Follow name of content (e.g., title of book, article, event, site)
    Filename: Same as resource name, adding the suffix ".md" to indicate a Markdown file
        No spaces
        Cap for first letter of each word
        Abbreviations:
            Apps = Applications
            Cse = CSE = Computational Science and Engineering
            Devpt = Development
            Eng = Engineering
            Hpc = HPC = High-Performance Computing
            Perf = Performance
            Sw = Software
            etc.
      Example filename: MyNewArticleTopic.md

Resource Deck:
    One-sentence resource description (limited length, appears in header area of frontend)
    
Resource Description:
    Concise paragraph explaining resource from the perspective of the CSE community
    Image file (e.g., logo) - optional (encouraged when this exists)

Contributor:
        Name(s) of contributor(s), hyperlinked to GitHub profile(s)
