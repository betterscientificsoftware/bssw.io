The *[Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://www.software.ac.uk/)* is a national facility, focusing on building better software. It is based in the UK and was founded in 2010. The mission of the *Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)* is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (better software, better research). Software is fundamental to research: seven out of ten UK researchers report that their work would be impossible without it.

As per the *SSI* manifesto, the Software Sustainability Institute represents the needs of software users and developers in the research community. They work towards the recognition of the role of software in research, better software education for the research community, recognition of the role of people who develop research software and better engineering of software to provide confidence in the results that software generates.
