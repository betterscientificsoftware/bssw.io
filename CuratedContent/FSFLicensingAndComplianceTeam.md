The [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) (FSF) is the organization behind the GNU "copyleft" licenses (e.g., GPL).  Their *[Licensing & Compliance Team](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/)* webpage provides a number of resources about the GNU licenses and their compatibility with other software licenses.  This information can be helpful when choosing a license for your software or understanding the implications of a license.
