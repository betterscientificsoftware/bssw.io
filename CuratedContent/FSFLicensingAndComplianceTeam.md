# Free Software Foundation Licensing & Compliance Team

The [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) (FSF) is the organization behind the GNU "copyleft" licenses (e.g., GPL).  Their [Licensing & Compliance Team](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/) page provides a number of resources about the GNU licenses and their compatability with other software licenses.  This information can be helpful when chosing a license for your software or understanding the implications of a license.
