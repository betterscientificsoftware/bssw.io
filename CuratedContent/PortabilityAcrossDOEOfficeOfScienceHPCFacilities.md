### Portability Across DOE Office of Science HPC Facilities

Achieving good performance across a range of platforms is an important goal for high-performance CSE software.  

This [DOE performance portability website](http://performanceportability.org) is intended to be a living/growing documentation hub and guide for applications teams targeting systems at multiple DOE Office of Science facilities. The site discusses differences between the systems, the software environments, and the job-submission processes. The site also discusses how to define and measure performance portability and provides recommendations based on case studies for the most promising performance-portable programming approaches.
