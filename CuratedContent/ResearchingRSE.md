Research software is usually created to address particular research questions, which means it often has special requirements that don’t align with typical commercial software.
This article  **[Investigating Research Software Engineering: Toward RSE Research](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/investigating-research-software-engineering-toward-rse-research/)** brings into focus Research Software Engineering (RSE) as an emerging field that’s both a career path and an area of study focused on bridging the gap between software development and scientific research.

The article walks through several important themes: first, it looks back at decades of traditional software engineering research, highlighting how its goals and methods don’t always meet the needs of scientific software. 
Then it introduces three major categories of research softwarem, along with explaining the growing focus on sustainability. 
The article also defines RSE as a profession and outlines why scientific software projects have unique challenges, such as unclear exploratory requirements, difficulty in validation, and limited use of standard engineering practices.
What makes this article  valuable is its the idea of RSE research, as a complementary approach to RSE, which aims to improve the scholarly understanding of research software development, and developing and improving the tools, techniques, and skills needed to create research software that’s reliable, reusable, and easy to adapt.
The article outlines key questions driving RSE research, including what sets it apart from other software research disciplines, how to better support scientific workflows with traditonal software engineering practices, which tools and skills are needed by RSEs, how education can evolve to meet those needs, and where technologies like generative AI might fit into this landscape.

In the end, the takeaway is simple but important -- that writing code isn’t enough. 
If we want research software to be robust and reusable, we need to step back and rethink how it’s designed, developed, and supported. 
The article also makes a strong case for international collaboration and better funding to help this emerging field grow.
