In the video *[Scaling Yourself as a Software
Developer](http://blog.martinig.ch/videos/scaling-yourself-as-a-software-developer/)*,
Scott Hanselman helps software developers (and others) prioritize productive
work, minimize interruptions (by self and others), have productive work
sprints, and organize and schedule necessary but possibly time-consuming tasks
such as email. He includes suggestions for planning your day and beyond so that
you don't become entangled or driven by other factors.

After watching this video and implementing a few of the recommendations, you
may find yourself breaking an "urgency" addiction and improving productivity.
At the very least your inbox will be cleared out quickly and the number of open
browser windows will shrink.  Productivity ideas and tools are suggested in the
video such as using a personal kanban and occasionally syncing to paper. 

The video also suggests tools you can use to organize activities that might
interrupt your productive software development time, but you would like to do
later, such as using a service like *Instapaper* to organize sites to read
later.  The video is entertaining and may even prompt you to get a pomodoro;
watch the video to find out why.
