### What are Interoperable Software Libraries? Introducing the xSDK

As computational science increasingly incorporates multiscale and multiphysics modeling, simulation, and analysis, the combined use of software developed by independent groups has become imperative: no single team has resources for the full range of capabilities needed for predictive science and decision support. 

This [WhatIs doc](https://ideas-productivity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IDEAS-InteroperabilityWhatAreInteroperableSoftwareLibraries-V0.2.pdf "What are Interoperable Software Libraries?: Introducing the xSDK") discusses software library interoperability, or the ability of two or more libraries to be used together in an application 
code, without special effort on the part of the user. The document also introduces the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit ([xSDK](https://xsdk.info)), a community endeavor focused on overcoming challenges in software interoperability and building the foundation of a scientific software ecosystem.
