The [*Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software*](https://collegeville.github.io/Workshops/) is intended to bring together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry and laboratories. While there are certainly existing exchanges between these communities, we are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions and career paths that span these communities.

The first workshop was the [*2019 Collegeville Workshop on Sustainable Scientific Software*](https://collegeville.github.io/CW3S19/). 

The [*2020 Collegeville Workshop on Scientific Software*](https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/) focused on developer productivity.  The live portion of Collegeville 2020 was held as a virtual meeting during July 21 - 23, 2020.  Contributions are available online, including 33 video recordings on the [*Collegeville 2020 YouTube playlist*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsqt6vUDjJ2lf4vs8xsX0YpBt-S-0c8t) and [35 white papers](https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/WorkshopResources/WhitePapers/WhitePaperList.html).
