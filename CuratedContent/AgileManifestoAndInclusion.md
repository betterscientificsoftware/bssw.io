Its no secret that the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) was crafted by a group of people who were almost exclusively older, white, western, males.
What assumptions and biases might have crept in as a result?

In the article we link to here, Marian Nodine identifies several assumptions she believes were baked into the Agile Manifesto and are worth reviewing through the lens of inclusion.
A common thread Nordine weaves through her review of the Agile Manifesto is related to assumptions about communication.

Is it possible for a team with mostly remote workers, for example, to address the principle of "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation"?
Must we read *"face-to-face"* in this principle, as it was written in 2001, *literally* and as excluding many of the tele-work options we have available today?

The article identifies 6 *assumptions* the author believes were baked into the Agile Manifesto and outlines how those assumptions may impact inclusivity in software projects.
