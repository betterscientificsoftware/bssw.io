Focus | Reproducibility and Replicability 

The [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability](https://reproducibility.acm.org/) aims to promote and improve research reproducibility in the computing field by establishing best practices, offering education and training, and providing resources and tools to enhance transparency and replicability. 
The group's website features information about its goals, activities, and resources, and has also highlighted news and events related to reproducibility in computing. 
The EIG has made efforts to establish a broad and inclusive intellectual community that emphasizes the importance of reproducible computational research. Their ultimate objective is to attain SIG (Special Interest Group) status within ACM.

The committee also collaborates with other organizations and conferences to raise awareness and promote reproducibility in the field.
The [ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability (ACM REP â€˜23)](https://acm-rep.github.io/2023/) is one such conference organized by this group which aims to bring together experts and practitioners engaged in the advancement and conduct of reproducible science in computing disciplines.

[Reproducibility for Everyone (R4E)](https://www.repro4everyone.org/)  is a community-led education platform to increase adoption of open research practices and help researchers enhance the reliability and credibility of their work, ultimately contributing to the advancement of scientific research.

The R4E website offers a range of online material and training resources to promote reproducibility, including open-access, reusable modules with instructor notes and guides, versionable and customizable content, and volunteers available to onboard new contributors, co-instructors, and organizers. 
The initiative has, in the recent past, hosted reproducibility workshops, supported by  volunteer co-instructors, that aim to bridge gaps in core researcher training, by offering concise yet informative introductions to novel tools and techniques. 
For individuals who are not familiar with reproducibility and replicability, the training material offered on this website can be helpful.
