[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) is a free and open
source feature-rich automatic documentation generator. 

Users very frequently choose to write documentation in the source code itself. *Doxygen* can automatically extract this documentation from the source code and export it to diverse formats such as browser-based online documentation in html or offline documentation such as Latex manuals, compressed HTML, PostScript, PDF files with hyperlinks, RTF format as well as Unix man pages. *Doxygen* supports many programming languages.

*Doxygen* allows documentation to be placed in the header as well as the source files. *Doxygen* processes markup describing classes, functions, and variables in your software's header/source files and generates a user-friendly hyperlinked set of web pages.  These web pages allow the user to navigate all the classes, functions, and variables and see 1) class hierarchy relationships; 2) input and output parameters for methods and functions; and 3) other variables and associated data.
