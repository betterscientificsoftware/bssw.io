# Publishing CSE Software

CSE software is used to generate many significant results
in the scientific literature.
The articles that present these results should have a way
to acknowledge the work that went
into developing the software, ideally via the same citation
mechanism used to acknowledge previous articles.
At the same time, making software visible to searches
of scientific literature will help potential users discover
software they may benefit from using.
As a community, we are still experimenting with various
methods of citing software while trying to keep up with the
rapidly accelerating scale, pace, and visibility
of scientific software development.

## Journals that Publish CSE Software

What follows is a short list of journals that specialize,
to varying degrees, in presenting a scientific software package as a
piece of scientific literature that can be cited by later works.
A longer and possibly more up-to-date list from the Software
Sustainability Institute that covers a wider
range of disciplines can be found [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software).

<!-- In alphabetical order by JOURNAL NAME (not initials) -->
 
 - [ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software](http://toms.acm.org) (TOMS):
   This is a well-established journal whose articles often describe
   novel algorithms and their implementation as mature, usable
   software products.
   It has also pioneered policies to improve the reproducibility
   of published research.
 - [ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation](http://tomacs.acm.org/about.cfm) (TOMACS):
   Another well-established journal, which deals more with applications,
   their impact and results, as well as their methodology
   (e.g., verification and validation).
 - [Archive of Numerical Software](http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ans/) (ANS):
   This journal aims to promote the re-use of high-quality scientific
   software libraries by publishing articles about application software
   that is based on these libraries.
   Authors need to submit a manuscript describing their software.
   ANS also accepts articles that introduce a new library, which may
   then form the basis of future application articles.
 - [Computing in Science and Engineering](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs) (CiSE): A joint publication of the IEEE Computer Society and the American Institure of Physics which is positioned at the intersection of science and computation and tends to publish papers that don't fit comfortably in either the "pure" science or "pure" computer science spaces.  It includes peer reviewed papers as well as a number of departments which publish shorted non-peer-reviewed articles.  The journal is open to topical special issues as well.
 - [The Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org) (JOSS): This journal provides
   authors with a DOI for their software package without requiring a
   full-length manuscript.
   Instead, authors must demonstrate (via a form of peer review) that
   their package follows certain best practices of open-source software,
   including proper licensing and documentation,
   and helps meet scientific research challenges.
 - [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) (JSS):
   Like TOMS, but with a focus on software which implements statistical
   methods rather than other mathematical modeling topics.  
 - [SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex/):
   An Elsevier journal that aims to ensure software
   is cited and gets credit in the literature.
   This journal accepts submissions regarding software that is used
   in any of a wide range of disciplines, from mathematics to the
   sciences and humanities.
 
Moving away from journals that require a manuscript and/or peer review, there are also
sites which can provide a DOI for your software with little to no review:
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
   Like JOSS, Zenodo can provide a DOI for your software.
   Unlike JOSS, it does not require a review of the software,
   and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub
   integration.
   Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their
   data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others
   to access that data.
 - [FigShare](https://figshare.com)
   Like Zenodo, figshare can provide a DOI for a snapshot of your software
   that you upload, although figshare is more commonly used to upload data
   such that it can also be cited from a journal article that produced or
   used said data.
   It is also often used to upload slides and posters in a way that makes them
   citeable.
