Focus |  Software publishing and citation

CSE software is used to generate many significant results in
scientific literature.  The articles that present these results
should have a way to acknowledge the work that went into developing
the software, ideally via the same citation mechanism used to
acknowledge previous articles.  At the same time, making software
visible to searches of scientific literature will help potential
users discover software they may benefit from using.  As a community,
we are still experimenting with various methods of citing software
while trying to keep up with the rapidly accelerating scale, pace,
and visibility of scientific software development.

## Software Sustainability Institute's Listing of Journals

The [Software Sustainability Institute in UK (SSI)](https://www.software.ac.uk/) maintains a webpage titled "[In which journals should I publish my software?](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)". This webpage provides a good list of current journals, divided into different categories such as "General journals", "Engineering", "Image Processing" etc.  

## Journals that Publish CSE Software

Listed below are some additional journals (which are not present in the above SSI's list), that specialize, to varying
degrees, in presenting a scientific software package as a piece of
scientific literature that can be cited by later works.  

<!-- In alphabetical order by JOURNAL NAME (not initials) -->
 
 - *[ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation](http://tomacs.acm.org/about.cfm) (TOMACS)*:
   A well-established journal, which deals more with applications,
   their impact and results, as well as their methodology
   (e.g., verification and validation).


 - *[ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io)*: ReScience C is an
   open-access peer-reviewed journal that encourages the explicit
   replication of already published research, promoting new and
   open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original
   research is reproducible. The journal focuses mostly on
   computational research.
 
 - *[Collective Science Platform (CoScience)/The Self-Journals of Science](http://www.sjscience.org)
   (SJS)*: This is a open curation platform, that allows scholars
   to freely curate published scientific articles (from any source)
   into SJS's self-journal tool. The tool provides a way for scholars
   to share their analysis of scientific output in a structured and
   comprehensive way, and thus enabling them to express their
   personal values and thoughts which cannot be usually expressed
   through traditonal publication channels.
 
Moving away from journals that require a manuscript and/or peer review, there are also
sites which can provide a DOI for your software with little to no review:
 - *[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)*
   Like JOSS, Zenodo can provide a DOI for your software.
   Unlike JOSS, it does not require a review of the software,
   and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub
   integration.
   Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their
   data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others
   to access that data.
 - *[FigShare](https://figshare.com)*
   Like Zenodo, figshare can provide a DOI for a snapshot of your software
   that you upload, although figshare is more commonly used to upload data
   such that it can also be cited from a journal article that produced or
   used said data.
   It is also often used to upload slides and posters in a way that makes them
   citeable.
