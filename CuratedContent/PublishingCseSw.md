Focus |  Software publishing and citation

CSE software is used to generate many significant results in
scientific literature.  The articles that present these results
should have a way to acknowledge the work that went into developing
the software, ideally via the same citation mechanism used to
acknowledge previous articles.  At the same time, making software
visible to searches of scientific literature will help potential
users discover software they may benefit from using.  As a community,
we are still experimenting with various methods of citing software
while trying to keep up with the rapidly accelerating scale, pace,
and visibility of scientific software development.

## Journals that Publish CSE Software

What follows is a short list of journals that specialize, to varying
degrees, in presenting a scientific software package as a piece of
scientific literature that can be cited by later works.  A longer
and possibly more up-to-date list from the Software Sustainability
Institute that covers a wider range of disciplines can be found
[here](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software).

<!-- In alphabetical order by JOURNAL NAME (not initials) -->
 
 - *[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software](http://toms.acm.org) (TOMS)*:
   This is a well-established journal whose articles often describe
   novel algorithms and their implementation as mature, usable
   software products.
   It has also pioneered policies to improve the reproducibility
   of published research.
 - *[ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation](http://tomacs.acm.org/about.cfm) (TOMACS)*:
   Another well-established journal, which deals more with applications,
   their impact and results, as well as their methodology
   (e.g., verification and validation).
 - *[Archive of Numerical Software](http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ans/) (ANS)*:
   This journal aims to promote the re-use of high-quality scientific
   software libraries by publishing articles about application software
   that is based on these libraries.
   Authors need to submit a manuscript describing their software.
   ANS also accepts articles that introduce a new library, which may
   then form the basis of future application articles.
 - *[Computing in Science and
   Engineering](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs) (CiSE)*:
   A joint publication of the IEEE Computer Society and the American
   Institure of Physics which is positioned at the intersection of
   science and computation and tends to publish papers that don't
   fit comfortably in either the "pure" science or "pure" computer
   science spaces.  It includes peer reviewed papers as well as a
   number of departments which publish shorted non-peer-reviewed
   articles.  The journal is open to topical special issues as well.
 - *[ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io)*: ReScience C is an
   open-access peer-reviewed journal that encourages the explicit
   replication of already published research, promoting new and
   open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original
   research is reproducible. The journal focusses mostly on
   computational research.
 - *[SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex/)*:
   An Elsevier journal that aims to ensure software
   is cited and gets credit in the literature.
   This journal accepts submissions regarding software that is used
   in any of a wide range of disciplines, from mathematics to the
   sciences and humanities.
 - *[The Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org) (JOSS)*: This journal provides
   authors with a DOI for their software package without requiring a
   full-length manuscript.
   Instead, authors must demonstrate (via a form of peer review) that
   their package follows certain best practices of open-source software,
   including proper licensing and documentation,
   and helps meet scientific research challenges.
 - *[The Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) (JSS)*:
   Like TOMS, but with a focus on software which implements statistical
   methods rather than other mathematical modeling topics.  
 - *[The Self-Journals of Science](http://www.sjscience.org)
   (SJS)*: This is a open curation platform, that allows scholars
   to freely curate published scientific articles (from any source)
   into SJS's self-journal tool. The tool provides a way for scholars
   to share their analysis of scientific output in a structured and
   comprehensive way, and thus enabling them to express their
   personal values and thoughts which cannot be usually expressed
   through traditonal publication channels.
 
 
Moving away from journals that require a manuscript and/or peer review, there are also
sites which can provide a DOI for your software with little to no review:
 - *[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)*
   Like JOSS, Zenodo can provide a DOI for your software.
   Unlike JOSS, it does not require a review of the software,
   and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub
   integration.
   Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their
   data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others
   to access that data.
 - *[FigShare](https://figshare.com)*
   Like Zenodo, figshare can provide a DOI for a snapshot of your software
   that you upload, although figshare is more commonly used to upload data
   such that it can also be cited from a journal article that produced or
   used said data.
   It is also often used to upload slides and posters in a way that makes them
   citeable.
