In *[Addressing the Detrimental Effects of Context Switching with DevOps](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/devops/2015/03/addressing-the-detrimental-effects-of-context-switching-with-devops.html)*, Todd
Waits makes the case that when a software developer switches from one project to
another an overhead of approximately 20 percent is incurred to perform the task.
The overhead is due to the amount of information a developer keeps in their
brain in order to perform development tasks. The article presents data that shows that the
overhead commpounds with an increase in the number of projects, making the
developer even less productive. It might be ideal for software developers to
devote 100 percent of their time on one project or even one task in that
project, but that is not usually the case, nor is it very practical. The
article has some helpful ideas about improving the process when context
switching does occur.

Some DevOps practices to mitigate the overhead of context switching outlined in
the article are:

 - Using Continuous Integration (CI)
 - Automatically assigning code reviews
 - Regular communication
 - Daily stand up meetings
 - Monitoring issue trackers for assignments
 - Limiting the number of projects for an individual

As a side note, another resource for practical team DevOps practices is the book *Implementing
Lean Software Development*. The book also contains information on the impact of
task switching and the resulting degraded productivity.
