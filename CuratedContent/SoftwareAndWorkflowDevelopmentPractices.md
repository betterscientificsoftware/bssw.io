# Software and Workflow Development

<!-- deck text start -->
Reproducibility and repeatability of scientific workflows that produce
research results are increasingly important. This article illustrates
experience implementing both software engineering practices for sustainability
of scientific software and practical methods to ensure repeatability and
reproducibility of computational workflows.

In *[Software and Workflow Development Practices](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2020-software-and-workflow-dev-practices.html)*,
the author relates the practical experience of a small academic scientific
research lab to ensure maintainability, sustainability, easy reuse and sharing
of both scientific software and computational workflows. The environment is an
academic research lab with an influx of people where the practices have been
successful for over a decade.  Like for many research teams, a small portion of
time is spent on software and workflow development while the majority of effort
is spent on understanding the results of their research. The article goes into
some of the specific tools, especially Snakemake, and languages they use that
may be helpful to some teams and also presents general useful practices helpful
for any research team. Some of the topics touched on are:

For Scientific Workflows:

 -  Version control code, analysis scripts and configuration for workflows
 -  Write scripts using a language that encourages modularity and reuse
 -  Automate workflows
 -  Use execution environments
 -  Implement demonstration data sets

Software engineering practices: 
 - Automated tests
 - Test Driven Development
 - Code review
 - Use issues (add pertinent conversations in other venues i.e. chat to issues)
 - Test, test, test
