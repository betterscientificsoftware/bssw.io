When writing software, destruction can be just as valuable as creation. The course *[Software Testing: How to Make Software Fail](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258)*, currently free of charge and offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), will help the audience learn how to catch bugs and break software as they discover different testing methods that will help them build better software. The focus of the course is learning how to make software fail and not software engineering testing theories. For the purpose of this course, some knowledge of algoritms and data structures would be useful, along with some knowlege of the Python programming language.
