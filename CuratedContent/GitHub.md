*[GitHub](https://github.com)* is a Git revision control repository service. In addition to providing a Git repository, *GitHub* provides a nifty graphical interface as well as several team collaboration tools, which includes tracking issues, setting milestones, wikis and integration with project management boards(called projects). Forking off repositories, creating pull requests and easy merging make *GitHub* a good tool for projects and teams.

*GitHub* provides both cloud-hosted and self-hosted offerings.  The cloud-hosted service offers a free service tier as well as paid plans.  All self-hosted offerings are paid.
