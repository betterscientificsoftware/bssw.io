Paper title  | Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing
Authors | Greg Wilson, Jennifer Bryan, Karen Cranston, Justin Kitzes, Lex Nederbragt and Tracy Teal
Publication | Year 2017, PLOS Computational Biology Journal, DOI: [110.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

The *Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing*, published in the *PLOS Computational Biology journal* in *June 2017*, presents a minimum set of practices for starting reproducible workflows needed for scientific computing research. 

The authors target researchers who are new to scientific computing,
short term projects, and small collaborative teams.  However, anyone who wishes
to improve scientific computing research practices can benefit from examining
the practices described. The title of the article is somewhat misleading, since
it covers many good practices, but may be interpreted by some to be "good
enough". This article is not meant be a guide to restructure practices of a
successful research team, but to aid individual new researchers and teams that
need to add or improve current practices. *Good Enough Practices in Scientific
Computing* can be a tool for the beginning graduate student, intern, or anyone
new to research computing.  Professors and mentors will find it beneficial to
direct students and interns to this article very early in their research.

The article starts with a summary of the specific practices organized into
the following key topics: 
* Data management
* Software
* Collaboration
* Project organization 
* Keeping track of changes 
* Manuscripts  

The practices include using manual methods or revision control systems for
preserving analysis procedures and manuscript development.  Including manual
procedures can help the beginner start good practices before learning git or
another versioning system. Data management suggestions include preserving raw
data, determining and producing "analysis-friendly" data, saving steps to
produce intermediate data, and submitting data to public repositories.  The
summary can be used as a checklist by new and mature researchers and team leads.
New scientific researchers will benefit from reading the article in its entirety
then carefully implementing the minimum practices.  The authors have assimilated
these practices from their personal experiences, and from the experiences of
thousands of participants in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops.
