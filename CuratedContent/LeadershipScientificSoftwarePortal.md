Focus | Building community and understanding around the development and sustainable delivery of leadership scientific software

The US Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is developing many of the important enabling technologies required for obtaining functionality and performance on upcoming exascale computers. As part of this effort, the ECP Software Technology (ST) focus area has established a macro-engineering software lifecycle to plan, execute, track, and assess product development toward the delivery of a curated portfolio of reusable, open-source software products called the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack or [E4S](https://e4s.io/).

During the final years of ECP, one key objective is to transition these efforts to a sustainable organization and model for continued development and delivery of future capabilities, including the incorporation of new scientific software domains, and expansion of the contributor and user communities.

The LSSw portal is dedicated to supporting communication and community building toward the sustainable development and delivery of Leadership Scientific Software.

Community resources include a mailing list and Slack channel in addition to the web site.  There are also Town Hall meetings which are organized on a monthly basis and archived on the portal site.
