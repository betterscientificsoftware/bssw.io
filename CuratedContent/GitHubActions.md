# GitHub Actions for Automation

<!--deck text start-->
From reminding reviewers of languishing PRs to packaging up release assets,
you can use GitHub Actions to automate all sorts of activities, not just CI,
in response to various events in your GitHub repositories.

The above web resources, *Getting Started with GitHub Actions* and *Getting the Gist of GitHub Actions*, provide a good starting point and overview of *GitHub Actions* service. These articles describe the basic concepts of GitHub Actions, such as workflows, jobs, and steps, and also present several simple example workflows. 


Some background on GitHub Actions service: 

GitHub introduced [*GitHub Actions*](https://github.com/features/actions) service in 2018.

> You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like,
> including Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery-Deployment (CI/CD), and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.


The GitHub Actions service is often described in the context of [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)
workflows. However, GitHub Actions, can go beyond this, and is designed to support automation of all kinds of tasks associated with a software project
and its repository(s). The naming is a bit confusing because *Actions* is used both in the (1) name of the service,
*GitHub Actions*, and (2) name of a key building block used in that service, *Actions*,
typically found in the [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).

The overarching abstraction, with GitHub Actions, is a [*workflow*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#understanding-the-workflow-file) defined by Yaml files in the `.github/workflows` of a GitHub repository. In this respect, GitHub Actions are similar to [GitLab's CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/). A workflow is
[*triggered*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows)
by various events in a repository and *uses* [*actions*](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
in preparation for executing one or more *jobs*, with whatever synchrony is needed.
Typically, the Yaml *scripts* defining workflows involve a combination of
GitHub-defined [yaml](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
keywords and syntax,
[*actions*](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) from the marketplace
and minimal amounts of python or shell code. In advanced cases, marketplace actions may be
customized or wholly new actions may
be implemented using either [JavaScript or Docker Containers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference).

Although GitHub's [REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference) has long
provided the functionality needed for projects to script up almost any workflow they
may wish, [*Actions*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference) were introduced
with the goal of providing an easier to use and more convenient interface. Whether
that goal was achieved may be debatable.  Certainly, one price to pay for this convenience
is that anything automated with GitHub Actions will likely work only on GitHub and
nowhere else. In fact, it is often difficult even to test
[GitHub Action workflows locally](https://github.com/nektos/act). Depending on the kind
of activity to be automated, it may be best for a project to minimize dependence on
Actions by using a single-job workflow that invokes a shell or python script where
the majority of actual automation work is implemented.
