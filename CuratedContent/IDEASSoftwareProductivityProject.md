# IDEAS Software Productivity Project

[Interoperable Design of Extreme-Scale Application Software (IDEAS)](http://ideas-productivity.org/).

The IDEAS Project is intent on improving scientific productivity by qualitatively changing scientific software developer productivity, enabling a fundamentally different attitude to creating and supporting computational science and engineering (CSE) applications.

We are creating an extreme-scale scientific software development ecosystem composed of high-quality, reusable CSE software components and libraries; a collection of best practices, processes, and tools; and substantial outreach mechanisms for promoting and disseminating productivity improvements. We intend to improve CSE productivity by enabling better, faster and cheaper CSE application capabilities for extreme-scale computing.
