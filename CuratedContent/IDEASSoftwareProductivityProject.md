# IDEAS Software Productivity Project

[Interoperable Design of Extreme-Scale Application Software (IDEAS)](http://ideas-productivity.org/).

The IDEAS project addresses productivity and sustainability concerns that are emerging from important trends in extreme-scale computing for science and engineering.

Focus | Developer productivity and software sustainability for extreme-scale CSE

Advances in next-generation computational science and engineering (CSE) require the development of applications that can fully exploit emerging extreme-scale architectures for optimal performance and provide high-fidelity multiphysics and multiscale capabilities. To help address overwhelming complexity, the IDEAS project focuses on improving scientific productivity by qualitatively improving developer productivity (positively impacting product quality, development time, and staffing resources) and software sustainability (reducing the cost of maintaining, sustaining, and evolving software capabilities in the future)—thereby enabling a fundamentally different attitude to creating and supporting CSE applications.

The IDEAS project is partnering with the community to create an extreme-scale scientific software development ecosystem composed of high-quality, reusable CSE software components and libraries; a collection of best practices, processes, and tools; and substantial outreach mechanisms for promoting and disseminating productivity improvements.  A goal is to improve CSE productivity by enabling better, faster *and* cheaper CSE application capabilities for extreme-scale computing.
