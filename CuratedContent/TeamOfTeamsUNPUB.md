Numerous CSE projects ([The DOE Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org), [Square Kilometer Array](https://skatelescope.org), [Blue Brain Project](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch) and [Energy Exascale Earth System Model - Formerly ACME](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/energy-exascale-earth-system-model) to name a few) are large, hierarchical organizations that produce and manage scientific software in  a complex environment. [The Team of Teams body of work](https://www.mcchrystalgroup.com/insights/teamofteams "Team of Teams: New Rules Of Engagement For A Complex World") (**NOTE: This link is no longer valid**) provides a collection of books, online resources and lectures on concepts and strategies for this kind of project.  A first resource from this collection is the book [Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486 "Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World").

Key concepts include the goals of:
- *Shared consciousness*: Establishing a common conceptual model and big picture understanding of the comprehensive project.
- *Empowered execution*: Fostering authority of sub-teams and individuals to act without explicit senior leadership consultation.

These resources can be useful for anyone engaged in large projects where requirements are multi-scale and emergent or, in other words, complex.
