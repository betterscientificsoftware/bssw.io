# Strategies for Working Remotely Panel Series

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and need for many in our
community to transition to unplanned remote work, the IDEAS
Productivity project has launched the panel series Strategies for
Working Remotely, which explores important topics in this area. The
series brings together staff members of DOE laboratories and invited
guests to speak about experiences in working remotely and
transitioning from co-located and partially distributed teams to fully
virtual teams, and teams of teams. Topics include challenges, lessons
learned, unforeseen benefits, and opportunities to look for from this
experience.

The event web site provides details about the panel series, including
announcements of upcoming panels, a mailing list to receive
announcements, and archival information for the entire series.

Upcoming panels are announced on the [BSSw Events
page](https://bssw.io/events), the IDEAS Productivity [announcements

Panels are free and open to the public. Advance registration is
required for each panel.

The panel series is produced by the [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org/) in collaboration with the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/).
