Most relevant to personal productivity is the finding that properly using self-regulated learning skills can save time and enhance learning outcomes. According to Stenger, "Self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies include things like goal-setting and structuring learning content, self-evaluation, putting rewards in place, group reflection, and note taking."  Other findings suggest that exercise and listening enhance foreign language learning and that getting good sleep allows us to use memory more efficiently.
