Focus | Reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science

The Turing Way is a wonderful handbook focused on reproducible, ethical, and collaborative computational and data science. 
As an online collaborative project, it brings together the expertise and experiences of various contributors in the field of data science and research.
The handbook features impactful illustrations and maintains a consistent, approachable writing style. 
While it may not be specifically centered on HPC, and certain details pertain to biomedical applications, the chapters on Reproducible Research, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration, and Ethical Research have significant relevance to HPC/CSE. You can access the handbook on The Turing Way website and find it also available through DOI.


*The Turing Way* project is open source, open collaboration, and community-driven.
It involves and supports a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone.
Its goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

> All stakeholders, including researchers, software engineers, project leaders and funding teams, are encouraged to use *The Turing Way* to understand their roles and responsibilities in ensuring reproducibility in data science. 
> The moonshot goal of *The Turing Way* is to make reproducibility *too easy not to do*.
