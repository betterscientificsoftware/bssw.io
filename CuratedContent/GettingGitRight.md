The distributed source management tool Git can be complicated to learn and use, especially for software developers who started with CVS or SVN or similar tools where there was always an official master repository.

The [Getting Git Right](https://www.atlassian.com/git) website provides a good collection of resources to learn about Git. It offers beginner resources for folks who simply want to learn about version control, source code managenent, installing Git and other basics. In addition, it offers advanced resources on how to migrate to Git, creating pull requests, merging, rebasing and learning about other advanced Git features!
