# ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software

[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)](http://toms.acm.org) is a well-established journal whose articles often describe novel algorithms and their implementation as mature, usable software products. It has also pioneered policies to improve the reproducibility of published research.

<!---
 - [TOMACS](http://tomacs.acm.org/about.cfm) (ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation):
   Another well-established journal, which deals more with applications,
   their impact and results, as well as their methodology
   (e.g., verification and validation).
 - [SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex/):
   An Elsevier journal that aims to ensure software
   is cited and gets credit in the literature.
   This journal accepts submissions regarding software that is used
   in any of a wide range of disciplines, from mathematics to the
   sciences and humanities.
 - [ANS](http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ans/) (Archive of Numerical Software):
   This journal aims to promote the re-use of high-quality scientific
   software libraries by publishing articles about application software
   that is based on these libraries.
   Authors need to submit a manuscript describing their software.
   ANS also accepts articles that introduce a new library, which may
   then form the basis of future application articles.
 - [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) (Journal of Statistical Software):
   Like TOMS, but with a focus on software which implements statistical
   methods rather than other mathematical modeling topics.
 - [JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org) (The Journal of Open Source Software): This journal provides
   authors with a DOI for their software package without requiring a
   full-length manuscript.
   Instead, authors must demonstrate (via a form of peer review) that
   their package follows certain best practices of open-source software,
   including proper licensing and documentation,
   and helps meet scientific research challenges.
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
   Like JOSS, Zenodo can provide a DOI for your software.
   Unlike JOSS, it does not require a review of the software,
   and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub
   integration.
   Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their
   data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others
   to access that data.
