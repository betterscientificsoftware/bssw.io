Good documentation plays an important role during the software development lifecycle, from planning to the maintenance phase. Having reliable documentation is essential for several reasons including information about where to and how to use the software, its range of validity, its technical details, recording the knowledge during different stages of the development cycle and easing the transfer of knowledge when team dynamics and personnel change over time.  A variety of tools exist for writing, rendering, and managing documentation. Some of the most popular ones are *[Doxygen](DocumentationTools.Doxygen.md)*, *[ReadTheDocs](DocumentationTools.ReadTheDocs.md)* and *[Sphinx](DocumentationTools.Sphinx.md)*.
