In their article *Ten Simple Rules for Catalyzing Collaborations and Building Bridges between Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Software Engineering Researchers (SERs)*, published in *IEEE Computing in Science & Engineering*, the authors share practical insights on how to strengthen collaboration between two communities that have historically worked in parallel but rarely intersected: Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Software Engineering Researchers (SERs).

Although both groups work with software in research contexts, they often have different goals, incentives, and ways of working. 
This article offers a way to bridge that divide, drawing on lessons from community experiences and conversations, including those from the Dagstuhl Seminar [*Research Software Engineering: Bridging Knowledge Gaps*](https://www.dagstuhl.de/24161).

The authors outline ten guiding principles for successful collaboration:

- Understand and respect the differences between RSEs and SERs  
- Be intentional - Don’t assume collaboration will happen on its own   
- Agree on shared goals and clearly define what success looks like  
- Engage with each other in your day-to-day environments  
- Focus on common software challenges where your expertise overlaps  
- Make sure the collaboration is beneficial for everyone involved  
- Be open to new opportunities and adapt as challenges emerge  
- Champion one another within your respective communities  
- Keep an eye on how the collaboration is going, and course-correct if needed  
- Seek institutional backing to help collaborations grow and thrive  

Whether you are a researcher, engineer or a team lead looking to build stronger and more impactful collaborations around research software, these guidelines provide a practical starting point for everyone.
