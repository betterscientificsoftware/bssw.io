*[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)* provides authors with a DOI for their software package without requiring a full-length manuscript or any (peer) review of the software, and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub integration. *Zenodo* also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others to access that data.
