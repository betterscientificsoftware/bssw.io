# Zenodo

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) provides authors with a DOE for their software package without requiring a full-length manuscript or any (peer) review of the software, and can generate a DOI for each release of your package via GitHub integration. Zenodo also allows users to upload data, and obtain a DOI for their data, while also acting as a hosting/distribution platform for others to access that data.
