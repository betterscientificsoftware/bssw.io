Computer professionals spend significant effort creating new languages for
many reasons. Can we evaluate the usefulness of new languages in reproducable
and reliable ways?

What makes one programming language better than another? What features in a programming language make
it more productive for software development? These are fundamental questions when deciding what language
to develop your application in, but according to an article in IEEE Computer, "... [a review] of the evidence standards 
of research presented at the International Conference on Functional Programming from its founding in 1996 to 2014 found that 
not one study followed methodological guidelines... Nevertheless, this research community has vehemently 
and successfully argued for the inclusion of functional features in popular programming languages such as Java, C++, 
and Snap!"
