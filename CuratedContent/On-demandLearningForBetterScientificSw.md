Applying on-demand learning strategies for self-paced “learning in the wild” can augment professional learning from massively open online courses (MOOC) such as EdX, Udacity, and videos available from YouTube and other sources. 

A forthcoming article will explain key points of self-directed online learning, including how to develop a transmedia learning framework (TLF) leveraging massively open online courses (MOOC), podcasts, social media, videos, practice environments, and more. The article is based on material presented in a tutorial at the [2nd Annual ECP Annual Meeting](https://www.ecpannualmeeting.com).  The tutorial featured a walk-through of relevant learning applications organized in a transmedia learning framework (TLF). Take-away practical strategies, resources, and tools that can be applied toward learning more productively were provided.
