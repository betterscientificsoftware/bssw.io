The *FORCE11 [Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group)* builds on the prior group's work. The activities of the *Software Citation Implementation Working Group* are to work with relevant stakeholders (publishers, librarians, archivists, funders, repository developers, other community forums with related working groups, etc.) to:

1. Endorse the principles.
2. Develop sets of guidelines for implementing the principles.
3. Help implement the principles.
4. Test specific implementations of the principles. During this process, the principles may also be updated based on feedback from the activities.
