# FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group

[FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/) is a community of scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers and research funders that has arisen organically to help facilitate the change toward improved knowledge creation and sharing. Individually and collectively, we aim to bring about a change in modern scholarly communications through the effective use of information technology.

The FORCE11 [Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group) builds on the previous [Software Citation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group), which developed and publicized an initial set of [software citation principles](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86). The activities of the Software Citation Implementation Working Group are: work with relevant stakeholders (publishers, librarians, archivists, funders, repository developers, other community forums with related working groups, etc.) to:
1. endorse the principles
2. develop sets of guidelines for implementing the principles
3. help implement the principles
4. test specific implementations of the principles.  During this process, the principles may also be updated based on feedback from the activities.
