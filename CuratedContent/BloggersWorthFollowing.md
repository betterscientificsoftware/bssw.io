Focus | Software development, management, and the Internet

Joel Spolsky has been involved in products such as FogBugz, Trello, Glitch, and Stack Overflow.  Though not a *scientific* software developer, he has a blog dating back to 2000 that includes many insightful articles about software development which are as useful for scientific software developers as others.  Though he is (semi-?) retired and not posting very often these days, many of his more than 1,000 past blog posts offer observations and insights which are as relevant today as when he originally wrote them.
