## Test of HTML comment handling

HTML comments look like this: `<!-- arbitrary text -->` (which we can see becasuse we marked it up as code)

Comments in regular text <!-- like this --> should be interpreted as comments.  They should be visible in the resulting HTML source, but not in the rendered version.

### Comments after headings <!-- should also be treated like comments -->

There should be some real text here, just for the sake of appearances

### References <!-- sfer_ezikiw -->

But due to a bug they were being rendered as visible text.

## Test images with relative paths
These images are referenced using relative URLs.  As of 2021-03, we are transitioning to prefer this approach over using fully qualified URLs.  All img URLs should reference
the bssw.io/images directory to work nicely with the typical authoring/development setup.  The front-end will translate such references to the images directory into GH URLs so that the content is ultimately served from the GH repo, as we have been doing.

[URL prefix: /images (should work on GH)]<img src='/images/Blog_1119_WorkThankful.jpg' />
[URL prefix: ../images (should work on GH)]<img src='../images/Blog_1119_WorkThankful.jpg' />
[URL prefix: ../../images (should *not* work on GH)]<img src='../../images/Blog_1119_WorkThankful.jpg' />

## Test images subdirectories
The following image calls test subdirectories in the images directory and filename collisions between images and its subdirectories.

[images/cats subdirectory: should be a cat]<img src='../images/cats/cat1.jpg' />
[images directory: should be the MolSSI logo]<img src='../images/cat1.jpg' />
