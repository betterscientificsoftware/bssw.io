# Open Source Initiative

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI) are the stewards of the Open Source Definition (OSD) and is the community-recognized body for reviewing and approving licenses as OSD-conformant.  The site provides the open source definition as well as a complete list of those licenses that the OSI has certified as Open Source.  As such, it is a major resource for selecting an open source license.  The site also supports the review process for licenses, and has a variety of information for those interested in Open Source community-building, education, and public advocacy.
