# What is DevOps?

## Mueller, Ernest, 2010, https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops

DevOps has become a catch-all term in agile organizations, but defiing what it *is* turns out not to be simple.  This blog post attempts to sort through the various ideas surrounding DevOps and bring some clarity to what is, at heart, a large and nuanced concept.

> DevOps means a lot of different things to different people because the discussion around it covers a lot of ground.

Mueller does a nice job of discussing many of the complexities and trade-offs in all this ground including a bit of history lesson, but two items stood out the most to me.

1. The discussion focuses on web apps - a common issue for HPC practioners. Don't let that stop you from understanding and applying these concepts.

2. Mueller includes an entire section titled `What is DevOps Not?` in which he walks us through a lot of the pitfalls and complaints that keep organizations from gaining the benefits of DevOps.

The post has been maintained with new content and reference links which may be more valuable than the actual prose.
If you are wondering about DevOps, having trouble supporting an existing code base, or just curious, this is worth a read.
