Focus | Python language and its use in HPC

Python is a very popular language in many domains. Traditionally, these are domains where speed of development and portability are more important than code performance. However, Python has now become popular in scientific computing and is becoming a de facto language for data science. Python is commonly used for rapid prototyping of numerical software and is becoming increasingly popular for implementing production software. Python is also used for application connectivity (glue) in many scientific workflows.

The Python for HPC community page helps scientists and programmers who are new to using Python get up to speed quickly with information that is specific to the scientific, and particularly, high performance computing domain. Secondly, it is a two-way resource, where users of any experience level can share information and links. The site contains articles, blogs and links on various aspects of the HPC Python ecosystem including Conda, Anaconda, Jupyter notebooks, Sphinx (documentation), testing (e.g. with pytest), linting and best practices. Up-to-date information is provided on scientific extensions such as NumPy, SciPy,  petsc4py, CuPy (NumPy for GPUs), and parallel tools and libraries such as multiprocessing and mpi4py.
