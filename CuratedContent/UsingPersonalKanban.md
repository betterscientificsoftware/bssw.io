A kanban board is a means of illustrating task management and the stages tasks
go through to completion. Sven Wiegand explains reasons to use a personal
kanban board to increase productivity.  The first part of the article details
problems with relying on todo lists, even with modern tools that have automated
reminders and completion due dates.
  
The second part illustrates the use of kanban boards to keep track of the state
and progression of tasks. He illustrates starting with a very basic kanban
board and the progression to more detailed boards with columns for various time
categories, such as weekly, monthly and yearly due dates. However, a personal
kanban board is just that, personal. So, you get to personalize the columns and
how to use them.

If you do not already have a personal kanban board and are interested in
creating one, there are many tools available. I was introduced to kanban boards
on projects that use issues and project boards in github repositories. That
prompted me to create a personal kanban board using gitlab issues, with separate
labels for each of my multiple projects. Using a personal kanban board does
not eliminate problems with context switching between projects, but is extremely
helpful. The follow-on article refers to several kanban resources and details
the use of one of them, Trello. Below are references to Part 2 of the series
and an article that describes using gitlab for kanban.
