Pull requests allow contributors to tell others about the modifications and changes made by them to a certain Git repository. Pull Requests (also called Merge Requests in Gitlab environments) enable qualitatively different workflows than direct commits to a repository.  

By explicitly requesting that a commit (a change to the repository content) be added to a repository, the effects of the commit can be reviewed, tested or refined and the commit eventually integrated or rejected, enabling better management of the repository quality and integrity. The article [How to submit a pull request](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-submit-a-pull-request-529efe82eea5) by [Zell Liew](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@zellwk) provides a nice conceptual and step-by-step description of how to submit pull requests on GitHub.
