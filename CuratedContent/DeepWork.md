*Deep work* is any work that required focused attention and concentration. The majority of tasks in scientific software will fall into this category. 

In your daily life, do you constantly get interrupted and find it difficult to focus on such work? Is your calendar so full of meetings that you have little time to actually work on projects?  If so, the book *Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World* from Cal Newport, a Computer Science Professor at Georgetown University and author of six books on the intersection of digital technicnology and culture, will be an interesting read. 

The author has also addressed this topic in a podcast.
