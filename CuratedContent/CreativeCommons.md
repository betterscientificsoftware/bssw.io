Licensing is an important topic that needs attention right from the inception time of the project!

*[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)* is a family of licenses, analogous to open source, but usually used for creative works other than software, such as documentation, written work, images, and sound and video recordings.  A number of variants of the *Creative Commons* license have been defined that give the licensor control of how they want to handle attribution, derivative works, redistribution, and commercial use.
