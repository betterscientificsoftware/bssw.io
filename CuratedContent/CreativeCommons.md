Licensing is an important topic that needs attention right from the inception time of the project!

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) is a family of licenses, analogous to open source, but usually used for creative works other than software, such as documentation, written work, images, and sound and video recordings.  A number of variants of the Creative Commons license have been defined that give the licensor control of how they want to handle attribution, derivative works, redistribution, and commercial use.
