Focus | Revision Control


Recently, many tools and workflows have emerged in the software industry that have greatly enhanced the productivity of development teams. GitHub, a site that hosts projects in Git repositories, is a popular platform for open source and closed source projects.  GitHub has encoded several best practices into easily followed procedures such as pull requests, which enrich the software engineering vocabularies of non-professionals and professionals alike.  GitHub also provides integration to other services (for example, continuous integration such as Travis CI, which allows code changes to be automatically tested before they are merged into a main development branch).   This presentation discusses how to set up a project on GitHub, illustrates the use of pull requests to incorporate code changes, and shows how Travis CI can be used to boost confidence that changes will not break existing code.
