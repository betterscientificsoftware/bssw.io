The Software Sustainability Institute's (UK)  *[Fellowship Programme](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme)* funds researchers in exchange for their expertise and advice.

The main goals of the Programme are gathering intelligence about research and software from all disciplines, encouraging Fellows to develop their interests in the area of software sustainability (especially in their areas of work) and aiding the Fellows as ambassadors of good software practice in their domains. The programme also supports capacity building and policy development initiatives.

Each Fellow is allocated funds to spend over a certain duration of months. The funding is flexible to support activities that are beneficial to both the Fellow’s and the Institute’s aims: for instance, to fund travel to conferences, to setup and run workshops, to organise software sustainability sessions at domain conferences, or to host, organise or teach at Software Carpentry or similar training events.

Fellows are drawn from a wide range of areas, experience, and career stages.
