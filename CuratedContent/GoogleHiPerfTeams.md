  This [interview podcast](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/matt-sakaguchi-google-performing-teams "High Performing Teams at Google") of [Matt Sakaguchi](https://qconsf.com/sf2016/sf2016/users/matt-sakaguchi.html "Matt Sakaguchi Profile") from Google lists items that have little to do with technical topics and everything to do with people and culture: psychological safety, dependability, structure & clarity, meaning and impact. Also, interesting to note, was how Google *used* to hire, which resulted in “all-star” teams that were less effective than current “championship teams,” who understand their roles and support one another.
