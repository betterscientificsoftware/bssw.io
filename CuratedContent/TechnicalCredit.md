# Technical Credit

<!--deck text start-->

Technical Credit is the proactive investment in software design and engineering practices aimed at enhancing long-term maintainability and adaptability; investigating its adoption is valuable because it provides a strategic counterbalance to technical debt, potentially reducing future costs and fostering sustainable software evolution.

**What Is Technical Credit?**

The concept of "Technical Credit" (TC) in software engineering serves as a counterpart to the well-established metaphor of ["Technical Debt" (TD)](https://bssw.io/items/technical-debt-in-practice-how-to-find-it-and-fix-it).
While TD refers to the future costs incurred by taking shortcuts in software development, TC represents proactive investments made to enhance a system's long-term adaptability and maintainability.​
One of the earliest references to the term "Technical Credit", playing off the "Technical Debt" metaphor, appears to be the 2014 article above.

Technical Credit is defined as the deliberate upfront investment in software engineering, design, and construction efforts that exceed the immediate requirements, with the anticipation that these efforts will yield long-term benefits as the system evolves.
Such investments might include:​

* Adopting newer tools and development practices
* Designing and implementing a modular architecture
* Investing in better testing frameworks​ and processes
* Developing/adopting a scalable testing infrastructure
* Investing in more up-front on-boarding and tutorial information

These practices aim to "grease the wheels" of future development, making it easier to implement new features, adapt to changing requirements, and maintain the system over time. ​

**Key Arguments and Takeaways from Technical Credit Articles**

Some of the key arguments and takeaways from these article are:

* **Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Goals:** While business pressures often prioritize rapid delivery, investing in TC can reduce future friction, leading to more sustainable development practices.

* **Predictable Evolution:** Software systems often evolve in foreseeable ways within their domains.
Anticipating these changes allows for targeted investments in TC that facilitate smoother transitions and integrations. ​

* **Lack of Formal Recognition:** Despite its potential benefits, TC has not been extensively studied or formalized within software engineering literature, indicating a need for further research and practical frameworks.

* **Complement to Technical Debt:** Managing TC alongside TD provides a more holistic approach to software quality, emphasizing both the mitigation of future issues and the enhancement of future capabilities. ​

**Practical Implications of Technical Credit:**

* **Strategic Planning:** Incorporating TC into project planning encourages teams to consider long-term impacts, leading to more resilient and adaptable systems.​

* **Resource Allocation:** Allocating time and resources to TC can result in reduced maintenance costs and faster implementation of future features.​

* **Cultural Shift:** Emphasizing TC promotes a culture of quality and foresight within development teams, aligning technical practices with business objectives.​

**Counter Arguments for Technical Credit**

Some of the obvious potential arguments against aggressive forms of TC applications include:

* **Inability to Predict the Future:** TC assumes an accurate prediction of future requirements and technology shifts, but developers often fail to foresee how software will truly evolve.

* **Similarity to "Big Upfront Design" (BUFD):** TC can inadvertently encourage extensive early-stage design and over-engineering, resembling outdated waterfall-style practices that Agile methodologies explicitly discourage.

* **Opportunity Cost and Resource Allocation:** Investing in TC diverts immediate resources from delivering user-visible features, potentially affecting market competitiveness or customer satisfaction.

** Difficulty Measuring ROI:** Unlike Technical Debt, where costs are measurable as they occur, the benefits of TC may be speculative, uncertain, or intangible, complicating justification to stakeholders.

* **Risk of Unnecessary Complexity:** Premature investments aimed at future-proofing may add unnecessary complexity, making software harder to maintain rather than easier.

Thus, critics argue TC risks repeating historical errors of overly ambitious initial designs and failing to acknowledge uncertainty and adaptability as key software-development principles.


**Summary**

In summary, Technical Credit potentially offers a fresh and valuable perspective on proactive software development practices.
By recognizing and investing in TC, organizations can build systems that are not only robust in the present but also prepared for the uncertainties of the future.
However, one should balance these potential benefits with the risks of higher initial costs and delays without the downstream payoffs (because we can't accurately predict the future in all cases).
