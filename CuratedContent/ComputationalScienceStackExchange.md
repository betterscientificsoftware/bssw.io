# Computational Science Stack Exchange

[Computational Science Stack Exchange](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/) is a question and answer site for scientists using computers to solve scientific problems.

This Stack Exchange site covers computational science in general.  Most of the questions tend to be more about algorithms and methods, and also about how to use particular software packages.  However there have been some questions in the software engineering, productivity, sustainability, and related areas.  And good questions in these areas are likely to attract more.
