The [Better Scientific Software (BSSw) tutorial website](https://bssw-tutorial.github.io) curates presentations of the BSSw tutorial by the IDEAS Productivity team at various venues.
Portions of the BSSw tutorial focus on developer productivity, software sustainability, and reproducibility in scientific research software particularly in high-performance computing.

There is some overlap of content between the various versions of the tutorial due to focus of each venue where it was presented.
For each tutorial, available resources variously include the slide deck, the video recording and in some cases, the repository of hands-on code accompanying the tutorial lessons such as the [Hello Numerical World](https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/hello-numerical-world-2021-11-15-sc) repository.

Whether a refresher or new insight on high performance computing is needed, this complete collection of all BSSw tutorial presentations (2016-present) is available for your perusal.
