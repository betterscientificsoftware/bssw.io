Have you ever had that experience where you're having a problem with your code and you can't figure it out.  You ask a colleague to to help you.  And as soon as you start explaining to them what the code is supposed to do, you figure out what the problem is?  It wasn't your colleague, it was really just the mindset associated with having to explain the code to them that allowed you to see what you'd missed until now.  This is the principle behind *Rubber Duck Debugging* or somtimes, simply *Rubber Ducking*.

The term dates back to Andrew Hunt and David Thomas's 1999 book *The Pragmatic Programmer*.  And it refers to the idea that you can do this without a human colleague -- any prop, such as a rubber duck or a stuffed animal, a pet, etc. that will help you get into the right mindset will work.  And perhaps with practice, you won't need a prop at all (though it is more fun).  The real point is having to explain what the code is *actually* doing in a detailed and precise way, line by line — as if you were explaining it to someone (or some thing) with no understanding of computers or what the software is meant to do, and not relying on what you *think* the code is (should be) doing.

The list of resources cited above on rubber duck debugging is far from exhaustive, but these present the idea in a thoughtful way, with some background and reasoning for the approach.
