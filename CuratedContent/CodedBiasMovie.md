# *Coded Bias:* A Film Highlighting Issues of Bias in AI Software
<!-- deck text start -->
The more scientific software is used in decision support, the more
serious the effects of unintended bias become up to and including
an outright threat to civil rights.

The 90 minute film, [*Coded Bias*](https://www.codedbias.com), discusses the
social justice implications and impacts of of bias in software. While the film
focuses primarily on big-data and AI software, the issues it raises are equally
applicable to any software used in decision support, including for example,
scientific computing software.

Some of the key take-aways are
  * We should beware of the tendancy to believe, sometimes falsely, automated algorithms are objective.
  * Just as the FDA regulates and oversees the safety, effectiveness and quality of
    *vaccines*, there needs to be an FDA for *algorithms*.
  * Algorithmic justice poses a significant threat to civil rights.
  * The film is a good resource for anyone in HPC/CSE looking to add to their
    Inclusion toolbox.

The film focuses on
[the work](https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212) of
[Joy Buolamwini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Buolamwini), founder of the
[Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org) in analyzing bias in facial
recognition software where she demonstrates various product's ability to even detect
a face correlates strongly with facial skin tone. The darker the subject's
skin, the less likely the software is to make a detection.

The film includes interviews with several other industry experts on bias in software.
It gives several examples of bias in AI and how that bias negatively impacts the lives
of real people. It also describes cases where big-data algorithms have demonstrated an
ability to abruptly influence the real world behavior of millions of individuals.
Buolamwini warns that algorithmic justice poses a great threat to civil rights.

It can be viewed at a number of [virtual cinemas](https://www.codedbias.com/virtualcinema). There
is a [free screening](https://www.meetup.com/AI-LA-Meetup/events/274929071/) available until
December 14th.
