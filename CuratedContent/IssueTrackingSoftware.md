Focus | Issue tracking and collaboration
 
Issue tracking software is used to make it easier for software developers to manage, record, track, resolve and be able to 
search on past issues, software bugs, or other problems. Issue tracking software is especially useful in eliminating 
duplicate efforts. 
 
Software developers who collaborate and work in a community environment want simple but effective tools that are intuitive and easy to use. At the same time, they want the tools to be robust and have options that are straightforward to understand and are beneficial to all team members. Some developers collaborate across countries and in different time zones and must work rapidly to meet hard deadlines. 

This article focuses on issue tracking tools for people who collaborate on scientific software across distances and disciplines (computer scientists, engineers, physicists, software developers, etc.) 

Folks in the scientific computing field need a myriad of capabilities from issue tracking systems:

1. Be accessible anywhere, from any system, i.e., web based
2. Be available for users both to report bugs and to track progress on requests
3. Allow developers to manage permissions for updating issues 
4. Provide email updates on status of issues
5. Allow priority setting on issues
6. Allow searching and sorting
7. Allow labeling issues with keywords to facilitate searching
8. Allow establishing and tracking milestones needed for resolutions
9. Allow both users and developers the ability to add and update notes
10. Provide links from the issue tracker to the commits in the software that represent progress on the issue
11. Be intuitive to new and casual users, and retain features needed by experienced developers 
12. Have a help package and good documentation
13. Be affordable  (no hidden costs)
14. Provide many features and functions - (features not used can be transparent)
15. Provide history tracking, intuitive workflow, continuous integration, and real-time collaboration

Most modern web-based repository hosting systems such as BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab provide integrated issue tracking systems and support most, if not all, of the capabilities listed above. 

This article lists issue tracking tools that are most frequently used by scientific software developers. However, in addition to issue tracking software, there exist several other options, such as trouble ticket systems used by HelpDesks across organizations. Some popular ones are ServiceNow, Remedy, Salesforce, Samanage, Wrike, etc.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems) has an extensive page comparing various issue tracking systems that are in use today.
