*[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org)* is a free and open source tool
that processes markup (it uses reStructuredText) describing classes, functions, and variables in your software's header files and generates a user-friendly hyperlinked set of web
pages.  These web pages allow the user to navigate all the classes, functions,
and variables and see 1) class hierarchy relationships; 2) input and output
parameters for methods and functions; and 3) other variables and associated
data.

*Sphinx* supports many programming languages.
Besides HTML documents it can also generate a LaTeX-generated PDF file and
the e-book format EPUB.

One can also include Doxygen generated XML content into *Sphinx*.
See the
[Breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/) extension for details.
