# Sphinx

Much like [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html),
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) is a free and open source tool
that processes markup describing classes, functions, and variables in your
software's header files and generates a user-friendly hyperlinked set of web
pages.  These web pages allow the user to navigate all the classes, functions,
and variables and see 1) class hierachy relationships; 2) input and output
parameters for methods and functions; and 3) other variables and associated
data.

Sphinx supports many programming languages.
Besides HTML documents it can also generate a LaTeX-generated PDF file and
the e-book format EPUB.

One can also include Doxygen generated XML content into Sphinx.
See the
[Breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/) extension for details.
