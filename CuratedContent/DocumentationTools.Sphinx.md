# Documentation Tools: Sphinx

As mentioned in [Documentation Tools](DocumentationTools.md), documentation
establishes the contract the client abides by when interacting with software.

Much like [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html),
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) is a free and open source tool
that processes markup describing classes, functions, and variables in your
software's header files and generates a user-friendly hyperlinked set of web
pages.  These web pages allow the user to navigate all the classes, functions,
and variables and see 1) class hierachy relationships; 2) input and output
parameters for methods and functions; and 3) other variables and associated
data.

Sphinx supports many programming languages, and can also generate a
LaTeX-generated PDF file.
