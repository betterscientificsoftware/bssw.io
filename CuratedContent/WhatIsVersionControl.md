### What is Version Control?

The short document [What is Version Control](https://ideas-productivity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IDEAS-VCWhatIsVersionControl-V0.1.pdf) provides a brief overview of Version Control Systems (VCS) and how they are useful in many projects (not just managing software soruce code).  This document gives some important definitions and terminology for VCS and briefly outlines the popular VCS tools Subversion (svn) Git, Mercurial (hg), and CVS and how they relate to each other.  It also outlines the most common and helpful use cases for VCS tools.
