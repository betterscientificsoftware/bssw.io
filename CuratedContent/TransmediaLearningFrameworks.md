<!-- deck text start -->
Applying on-demand learning strategies for self-paced "learning in the wild" such as the use of a transmedia learning framework (TLF) can augment professional learning from massively open online courses (MOOC) such as Udacity, and videos available from YouTube and other sources.

### Using Resources and Technology to Optimize Your Productivity

In this [on-demand learning blog post](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/on-demand-learning-for-better-scientific-software-how-to-use-resources-technology-to-optimize-your-productivity) the author answers questions from participants in a webinar about challenges associated with learning in the wild (i.e., as it naturally occurs in a social context).
The webinar explains key points of self-directed online learning, including how to develop a transmedia learning framework (TLF) leveraging massively open online courses (MOOC), podcasts, social media, videos, practice environments, and more. The webinar is based on material presented in a tutorial at the [2nd Annual ECP Annual Meeting](https://www.ecpannualmeeting.com).  The tutorial featured a walk-through of relevant learning applications organized in a transmedia learning framework (TLF). Take-away practical strategies, resources, and tools that can be applied toward learning more productively were provided.
