#  Training Resources for Software Productivity and Sustainability

Information on effective practices for scientific software can help individuals and groups to improve software quality while decreasing the effort, time, and cost to develop, deploy, maintain, and extend software over its intended lifetime.  Improving software practices thus promotes more effective CSE collaboration through software and helps to increase overall scientific productivity.

A variety of tutorials, webinars, and training sessions provide resources for improving various aspects of software productivity.
