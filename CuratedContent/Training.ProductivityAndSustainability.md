Information on effective practices for scientific software can help individuals and groups to improve software quality while decreasing the effort, time, and cost to develop, deploy, maintain, and extend software over its intended lifetime.  Improving software practices thus promotes more effective CSE collaboration through software and helps to increase overall scientific productivity. The *CSE Collaboration Through Software: Improving Productivity and Sustainability* and the *Webinar Series: Best Practices for HPC Software Developers* provide diverse resources to help achieve our goals for developer productivity and software sustainability.
