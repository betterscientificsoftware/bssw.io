Testing is executing a set of steps and processes in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements. Do you understand the software testing processes and frameworks involved for testing any general purpose software? Do you know how to make software fail with a goal of building better, bug-free, and a high-quality product? On this page, we provide pointers to testing tutorials for general-purpose software. These tutorials are good resources also for CSE software.

The course *[Software Testing: How to Make Software Fail](SwTestingUdacity.md)*, currently free of charge and offered  by *[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)* will help the audience learn how to catch bugs and break software as they discover different testing methods that will help them build better software.

This *[Software testing tutorial](SwTestingTutorialTutorialsPoint.md)* from *[TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm)* will give you a basic understanding on software testing, its types, methods, levels, and other related terminologies.
