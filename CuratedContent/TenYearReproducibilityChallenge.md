*[Challenge to scientists: does your ten-year-old code still
run?](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02462-7)* presents interesting
findings from the challenge, originally conceived in 2019, and taken the following year
by a total of 38 participants.
The challenge dared scientists to reproduce results from computational
papers they published ten years previously, or earlier. The purpose was to find
techniques to produce code and results that can be reproduced a decade later.

While you may not experience the problems that were encountered by the participants,
such as retrieving software from a floppy disc or other obsolete technology, or
having your hand-written notes destroyed in a fire, it would still be wise to
consider what would be necessary to allow you to reproduce your results in ten years.
While there are many current technologies and practices that aid in reproducibility,
there are also many new challenges, such as "rapidly evolving API's and reliance
on third-party libraries" and fragmented code due to use of computational
notebooks.  One common thread suggested from participants to encourage
reproducibility is to increase documentation. Additional useful ideas can be
found in the included reproducibility checklist.
