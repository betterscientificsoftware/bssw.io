# Ten Year Reproducibility Challenge 
<!-- deck text start -->
Will your software be able to pass the ten-year reproducibility challenge? This article presents the findings of 38 scientists who took the challenge, in 2020, to reproduce results in previously published computational papers.

*[Challenge to scientists: does your ten-year-old code still
run?](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02462-7)*, presents interesting
findings from the challenge conceived in 2019 and taken by 38 participants in
2020. The challenge dared scientists to reproduce results from computational
papers they published ten years ago or earlier. The purpose was to find
techniques to produce code and results that can be reproduced ten years later. 


You may not experience the problems that were encountered by the participants
such as retrieving software from a floppy disc or other obsolete mediums, or
having your hand written notes destroyed in a fire, but you would be wise to
consider what is needed to be able to reproduce your results in ten years.
There are many current technologies and practices that aid in reproducibility,
but there are also new challenges such as "rapidly evolving API's and reliance
on third-party libraries", and fragmented code due to use of computational
notebooks.  One common thread for increased reproducibility of results was to
up documentation, other useful ideas can be found in the included
reproducibility checklist.
