# Research Software Quality Kit (RSQKit)
<!-- deck text start -->

Producing and sustaining research software requires making informed choices under real-world constraints.
The Research Software Quality Kit (RSQKit) is an evolving set of information, resources, and tools for all roles involved in a research software project.

Focus | Support for research software quality and sustainability

Most research software is developed under real-world constraints: limited time, discovery-driven and evolving requirements, and varied expectations about reuse, sustainability, and credit, and, of course, funding and budget considerations.
RSQKit, developed through the [EVERSE project](https://everse.software/) brings together information and tools that map roles, tasks, lifecycles, and goals to help practitioners reason about research software quality practices.

The goal of RSQKit is to provide resources that enable anyone involved in producing or maintaining research software that is "repeatable, reproducible, trustworthy, resilient, understandable, efficient, adaptable and maintainable".
RSQKit organizes its content into selectable topics that expand into a side-panel navigation.
These topics include:

- **Research software & quality** - definitions and considerations
- **Research software stories** - examples of research software and their quality practices
- **Research clusters & infrastructures** - use cases and practices across research communities
- **Roles** - tailored to different roles in research software funding and development
- **Tasks** - an alphabetical (easy to search) list of guidelines and solutions for tackling common software tasks
- **All Indicators** - browse quality indicators and their connections to tasks
- **All tools and resources** - browse tools and resources for research software quality
- **Get involved** - resources on how to contribute to RSQKit

If you produce, manage, or fund research software, RSQKit offers a well-organized and accessible collection of resources to support your work and decision-making.
