The *Guide for Inclusive Scientific Meetings*, authored by the  *500 Women Scientists* organization, presents post-pandemic recommendations for getting the most out of planned scientific meetings/gatherings by maximizing inclusivity and equality. 

This updated 2023 guide (previously published in 2019) provides guidance for a range of meeting modalities -- in-person, hybrid, and virtual formats. The document begins with an overview of some excellent principles of inclusion before continuing into the main sections of 1) planning the meeting, 2) during the meeting, and 3) assessing the meeting. It also stresses and brings forth the need of methodologically integrating diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility (DEIJA) at every stage of inclusive scientific meetings. The Guide targets people in planning and leadership positions (co-chairs, steering committees, subcommittees, organizers, etc) for scientific meetings and seeks to reframe the process of meeting planning with awareness and equitable participation. 

A noteworthy section of the guide worth highlighting is the *assessing the meeting* section, the focus of which is to help organizers evaluate and assess if their scientific spaces and meetings are indeed truly inclusive, equitable, and accessible at all stages of the meeting (before, during, and after). Recognizing the importance of online meetings during the pandemic years  - this guide seeks to take the learnings and best practices gained such online/virtual (zoom/teams) interactions and apply them to in-person/hybrid meetings. For scientific computing audience for whom meetings are a big part of their day-to-day life, this guide delves into the *the fine points and the art of conducting inclusive scientific meetings and how to do them really well from start to finish.* 

The resource is well worth a read, particularly with a view to the resuming frequency of in-person interactions around us.
