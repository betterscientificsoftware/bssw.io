# Working Effectively with Legacy Code

## Feathers, Michael, 2005

Legacy software is very hard to modify and extend as it often relies on obsolete software and hardware, lacks testing, and may have no devlopers familiar with it's complexities.
This book gives one hope that we can use targeted, incremental, unit testing and refactoring to turn legacy software into better tested, understood, and extensible software while implementing and delivering new functionality at the same time.
If one reads the book "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler and one felt a little uneasy about how this would apply to large nasty software projects, then Working Effectively with Legacy Code is the book to read.
What’s more, Michael mentions and reviews many of the object-oriented principles in Agile Software Development as well as other little bits of information that one would find in other great books about software development.
One can view this book as the logical culmination of the books "Refactoring" and "Test Driven Development" (TDD), it's where the rubber meets the road combining unit testing and refactoring.
This book is packed with practical examples that show nearly every trick there is for refactoring nasty code to break dependencies and getting code into a unit test harness.
By the time one is done reading this book you should be convinced of the need for unit testing and TDD.
