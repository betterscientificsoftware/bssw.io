# Contributor Agreements

Contributor agreements are a way of managing a variety of legal issues associated with *receiving* (software) contributions to an open collaborative project.  The [Contributor Agreements](http://contributoragreements.org/) site provides resources to help projects understand and select a contributor agreement, if they want to use one.  The long-term goal of the effort is to consolidate around a small number of standardized contributor agreements that serve the broad needs of the community, similar to the Creative Commons family of licenses.
