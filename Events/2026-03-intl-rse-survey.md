The Research Software Engineering (RSE) community continues to grow, and in order for the SSI and the many national RSE associations to properly support it, we need to hear from you. We have launched the 2026 International RSE Survey to help us better understand what RSEs need and how we can advocate for the community with policymakers and funders.

The RSE Survey produces an incredibly valuable trove of data that anyone can use to understand the RSE community, including national associations, funders and policymakers. Please help us provide this data and support the RSE community by completing the survey.

You can complete the 2026 International RSE Survey in English, French, German or Spanish.

You don’t need to be called an RSE to complete the survey. Your formal job title does not matter - if you develop software for academic research as part of your work, we want to hear from you. 

The survey collects a considerable amount of detail about your role, the type of work you conduct, your working practices, job satisfaction and demographics. This means it takes around 20 minutes to complete. We appreciate that this is a significant amount of your time to donate, and we thank you for it!

The survey closes on 20 March 2026.
