### Abstract
The DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Software Technology focus area is developing an HPC software ecosystem that will enable the efficient and performant execution of exascale applications. Through the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) [https://e4s.io], it is developing a comprehensive and coherent software stack that will enable application developers to productively write highly parallel applications that can portably target diverse exascale architectures. E4S provides both source builds through the Spack platform and a set of containers that feature a broad collection of HPC software packages. E4S exists to accelerate the development, deployment, and use of HPC software, lowering the barriers for HPC users. It provides container images, build manifests, and turn-key, from-source builds of popular HPC software packages developed as Software Development Kits (SDKs). This effort includes a broad range of areas including programming models and runtimes (MPICH, Kokkos, RAJA, OpenMPI), development tools (TAU, HPCToolkit, PAPI), math libraries (PETSc, Trilinos), data and visualization tools (Adios, HDF5, Paraview), and compilers (LLVM), all available through the Spack package manager. It will describe the community engagements and interactions that led to the many artifacts produced by E4S. It will introduce the E4S containers is installed on BlueWaters (NCSA) using Shifter and this talk will demonstrate its usage.

### Presenter Bio
Sameer Shende serves as the Director of the Performance Research Laboratory at the University of Oregon and the President and Director of ParaTools, Inc. and ParaTools, SAS in France. He serves as the lead developer of the TAU Performance System, Program Database Toolkit (PDT), HPCLinux, and Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S.io). His research interests include performance instrumentation, compiler optimizations, measurement, and analysis tools for HPC. He leads the SDK project for the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), in the Programming Models and Runtime (PMR) area to provide ECP Software Technology (ST) products in a containerized environment for HPC. He has served as the the chair of the Performance Measurement, Modeling, and Tools track at SC17 and the co-chair for the technical program at the ICPP 2018 conferences. He received his B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 1991, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Oregon in 1996 and 2001 respectively.
