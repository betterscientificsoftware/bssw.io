### Abstract
<p>In recent years scientific software projects have increasingly
incorporated state-of-the-art technical best practices like continuous
integration into their development cycle. However, many projects still
struggle to create and maintain an active and welcoming user/developer
community, and there exists little documentation on what makes a
scientific software community successful. In this webinar I will
introduce my work — as a Better Scientific Software Fellow — to
collect typical social challenges and potential solutions that arise
during the evolution of a scientific software project. Aimed at
current and prospective software maintainers and community leaders, I
will discuss topics such as building and maintaining a welcoming
community atmosphere, overcoming skepticism of sharing science and
software, mediating between users working on conflicting topics or
publications, and providing credit and growth opportunities for
community members. Finally, I hope to initiate a conversation among
project and community leaders about what makes communities successful
so that we can learn from each other and improve scientific software
development together.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Rene Gassmoeller is Project Scientist at
the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics at the University of
California, Davis. His research focuses on the interaction between
mantle convection and plate tectonic processes, numerical methods for
geodynamic modeling, and sustainable software development in the Earth
Sciences. He received a Ph.D. in Geophysics from Potsdam University in
cooperation with the German Research Centre for Geosciences.</p>
