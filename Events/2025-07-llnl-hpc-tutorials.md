- Registration deadlines: July 14 - September 15th, 2025
- Event Dates: July 15 - September 16, 2025
- Location: Online
- Website: https://hpcic.llnl.gov/2025-hpc-tutorials
- Organizers: LLNL's High Performance Computing Innovation Center

Throughout the summer, join our free tutorials on how to install and use a variety of HPC packages with hands-on exercises on AWS EC2 instances (provided).
All experience levels are welcome.

LLNL's High Performance Computing Innovation Center will host a series of free tutorials covering a wide range of HPC software topics including package management, memory management, workflow management, portability, performance, visualization, math libraries, and more.
Software teams will walk you through installation, configuration, and getting started.
Attendees will be provided with AWS instances so that they can follow along with the tutorials in real time.
No previous experience necessary, and everyone is welcome.
You can sign up for any/all of these tutorials.
