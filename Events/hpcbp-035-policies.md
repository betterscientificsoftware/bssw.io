This event is a part of the "Best Practices for HPC Software
Developers" webinar series, produced by the IDEAS Productivity
Project. The HPC Best Practices webinars address issues faced by
developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on
high-performance computers (HPC) and occur approximately monthly.

### Abstract
<p>The development of increasingly complex architectures and software
ecosystems continues. Both the multiphysics modeling simulations and
the coupling of modeling and data analytics applications increasingly
require the combined use of software packages developed by diverse,
independent teams throughout the HPC community. The Extreme-scale
Scientiﬁc Software Development Kit (xSDK) is being developed to
provide such an infrastructure of independent mathematical libraries
to support productive and efficient development of high-quality
applications. This webinar will discuss in more detail the development
and impact of the xSDK community policies, which constitute and
integral part of the project and were defined to achieve improved code
quality and compatibility across xSDK member packages and a
sustainable software ecosystem.</p>



### Presenter Bios
<p>Ulrike Meier Yang leads the Mathematical Algorithms &amp; Computing Group
in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing of Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory. She leads the xSDK project in DOE’s Exascale
Computing Project and the Linear Solvers topical area in the SciDAC
FASTMath Institute; she is a developer of the software library
hypre. She earned her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research interests are numerical
algorithms, parallel computing, and scientific software design.</p>
<p>Piotr Luszczek is a research assistant professor at the Innovative
Computing Laboratory in the University of Tennessee. Piotr earned his
Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. His research interests include benchmarking, numerical
linear algebra for high-performance computing, automatic performance
tuning, and stochastic performance models. He has over a decade of
experience developing HPC numerical software for large-scale,
distributed-memory multicore systems with hardware accelerators. Piotr
serves as a co-PI on the ECP xSDK project that aims to improve access
to world-class software on exascale machines.</p>
