### The College Workshop Series on Scientific Software

The Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software brings together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry and laboratories.  We are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions, and career paths that span these communities.

The first workshop in 2019 focused on software sustainability.  The 2020 workshop will focus on developer productivity.
