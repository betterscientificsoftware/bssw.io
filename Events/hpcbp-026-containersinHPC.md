### Abstract
<p>Containers have gained adoption in the HPC and scientific computing
space through specialized runtimes like Shifter, Singularity and
Charliecloud. Containers enable reproducible, shareable, portable
execution of applications. In this webinar, we will give a brief
introduction on how to build images and run containers on HPC
systems. We will also discuss some best practices to ensure containers
can take full advantage of HPC systems.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Shane Canon is a Senior Engineer at Lawrence Berkeley
Lab where he works in the NERSC Supercomputing Facility.  Over Shane&#8217;s
20 year career, he has focused on enabling scientists to conduct
breakthrough science using large-scale systems including some of the
fastest computers and storage systems in the world.  Most recently
Shane has focused on enabling data-intensive computing and container
computing on Supercomputing systems.  Shane is also a senior member of
the DOE KnowledgeBase (KBase) project which is building a platform to
conduct biological research that can easily be shared and reproduced.</p>
