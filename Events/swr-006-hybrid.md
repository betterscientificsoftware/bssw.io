### Abstract
<p>In Spring 2020 many workers abruptly transitioned from a primarily on-site to a primarily remote work experience.  Many people will be (or already are) transitioning to a hybrid experience, spending some days on site and some remote.  Working in this hybrid setting is likely to last longer for many people than the primarily remote setting.  For some, the hybrid setting may go on indefinitely. In this panel discussion, we learn from colleagues who have worked in a hybrid setting during their careers, as well as some who are new to remote work.  We will discuss some of the challenges we have faced in primarily remote settings and how these challenges might be addressed in hybrid settings. Themes will include making effective use of time on site, best practices and principles for teams who are blended remote and on site, and how to be effective and efficient in long-term hybrid settings.</p>

### Panelist Bios
<p>Katie Antypas is the Division Deputy and Data Department Head at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Katie was the Project Director of the NERSC-8 Cori supercomputer deployed in 2016 and served as the Project Director for the NERSC-9 Perlmutter system from 2017-2019. She is also the director of Hardware and Integration for the ECP project and a co-investigator on the ASCR research project titled, “Science Search: Automated MetaData Using Machine Learning” and is interested in how experimental science facilities can leverage High Performance Computing.  Her interests include application readiness for advanced architecture systems, I/O performance,  data movement and management and supporting experimental science on HPC systems. Before coming to NERSC, Katie worked at the ASC Flash Center at the University of Chicago on the FLASH code, a highly scalable, parallel, adaptive mesh refinement astrophysics application. She has an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago and a bachelors in Physics from Wellesley College.</p>
<p>David E. Bernholdt is a Distinguished R&amp;D Staff Member in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. His research interests are, broadly, in software environments for high-performance scientific computing.  Over his 20-years at ORNL he has led and participated in many different projects focused variously on computer science or computational science research, nearly all “hybrid” in the sense of being multi-institutional and geographically distributed.  He also has experience (pre-COVID) managing a “hybrid” group.</p>

<p>Mark C. Miller is a software engineer in the Applications, Simulation and Quality (ASQ) Division at Livermore Labs with 25+ years experience in high performance computing (HPC) visualization and data analysis applications. Mark is also member of the IDEAS-ECP project. For his entire career, management at LLNL has enabled Mark to have a hybrid schedule involving telecommuting and real commuting from his home in Davis, a distance of about 100 miles. For several years, he rented a room in the local Livermore area for routine overnight stays.</p>

<!-- Bio for panel 1
Mark C. Miller, a software developer at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory supporting HPC visualization tools, has worked remotely,
part-time, for 10+ years from Davis, CA.  His home office setting
involves only his wife (no children or pets), a separate room for an
office, an LLNL provided laptop and peripherals and Comcast/Xfinity’s
lowest tier internet service plus Verizon hot-spot with 8Gb/mo data
limit.  Mark is a member of the IDEAS-ECP productivity project.

<p>Hai Ah Nam is a computational physicist in the Computational Physics &amp; Methods (CCS-2) Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory with a background in low-energy nuclear physics, large-scale scientific computing and high-performance computing.  Hai Ah is a member of the IDEAS-ECP project, the coordinator of the Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program and an advocate for developer productivity and software sustainability.  Most people only know Hai Ah by voice.</p>
<p>Valerie Taylor is the Director of the Mathematics and Computer Science Division and a Distinguished Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory.  She has over 25 years of research experience in HPC, with a focus on performance analysis, modeling and tuning of parallel, scientific applications. Prior to joining Argonne, she a Regents Professor and the Royce E. Wisenbaker Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University. Valerie is an IEEE Fellow and ACM Fellow.</p>
    


### Moderator Bios
<p>Ashley Barker is the Group Leader for the User Assistance and Outreach
(UAO) team at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF)
located at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). UAO is responsible for
facilitating access to OLCF resources, providing training,
documentation, and technical support to users, collecting and
reporting on user facility data, and acquainting the public with the
work conducted at the OLCF through scientific highlights. The OLCF
supports more than 1,200 users and 250 projects annually from a wide
spectrum of science domains. Ashley served as the National Climate
Research Center (NCRC) Project Director from 2014-2016. The NCRC
project represents a partnership between NOAA and DOE and through this
partnership, the NCRC team has delivered multiple computer systems to
NOAA, allowing the agency to advance its climate modeling and improve
our understanding of climate variability and change. Ashley is also
currently involved in the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) as the
Control Account Manager (CAM) for training and productivity.</p>
<!-- Bio for panel 1 -->
<p>Mike Heroux has worked remotely for nearly 23 years from rural central
Minnesota, briefly as Director of Applications at SGI/Cray, then as a
staff member in the Center for Computing Research at Sandia National
Laboratories. Mike is presently the director of software technology
for ECP and a Scientist in Residence at St. John’s University, MN.</p>
<!-- Bio for moderator 4 -->
<p>Elaine Raybourn is a social scientist in the Statistics and Human
Systems Group (Applied Cognitive Science) at Sandia National
Laboratories. Her research focuses on virtual teams, software
developer productivity, and transmedia learning. She has worked
remotely for a combined total of 14 years while at Sandia National
Laboratories: from the UK as a guest researcher at British Telecom;
Germany (Fraunhofer FIT) and France (INRIA) as a Fellow of the
European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM),
and most recently from Orlando, Florida as Sandia’s Institutional PI
for the IDEAS-ECP productivity project. She leads the panel series
<em>Strategies for Working Remotely</em>.</p>
