### Abstract
<p>Many virtual student internship programs across the national labs complex, industry, and academia are underway with students working remotely while geographically dispersed. What does a “virtual internship” lack, and what changes to mentoring or onboarding must be made? How can students get the most out of their internships—what opportunities should they look for, and how can they prepare for challenges? In the ninth installment of the panel discussion series, seasoned scientists offer career advice for students and early career scientists on weathering a pandemic, time management, and how to adjust to long-term changes while working remotely.</p>

<p>Rebecca Hartman-Baker leads the User Engagement Group at NERSC, where she is responsible for engagement with the NERSC user community to increase user productivity via advocacy, support, training, and the provisioning of usable computing environments. She worked as a postdoc and then as a scientific computing liaison in the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, and a senior supercomputing applications specialist at the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Australia before joining NERSC in 2015. She has mentored many students in her career, hosting summer interns ranging from high school students to graduate students. She is also a supporter of student cluster competitions; Rebecca trained two Australian teams and two all-female NERSC teams for the competitions, and chaired the Student Cluster Competition at SC19.</p>

Rebecca Hartman-Baker leads the User Engagement Group at NERSC, where
she is responsible for engagement with the NERSC user community to
increase user productivity via advocacy, support, training, and the
provisioning of usable computing environments. As part of this effort,
she produces a podcast, "NERSC User News", covering topics of interest
to NERSC users, which is syndicated on iTunes, Google Play, and
more. She worked as a postdoc and then as a scientific computing
liaison in the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, and a senior
supercomputing applications specialist at the Pawsey Supercomputing
Centre before joining NERSC in 2015. Rebecca has hired several dozen
people, including students, postdocs, and staff, but until recently
had never onboarded anyone remotely. This summer she is welcoming two
new staff members and four student interns into her group.
