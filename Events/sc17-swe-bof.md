# Software Engineering and Reuse in Computational Science and Engineering (Birds of a Feather)

- Dates: November 14, 2017
- Location: SC17, Denver, CO
- Event Website: http://sc17.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof144&sess=sess374

This is a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session at the SC17 conference.

**Description:**  Software developers, researchers, trainers, and outreach staff will meet to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities for developing and promoting software engineering practices, including the development of reusable software to enhance the computational science and engineering ecosystem for HPC systems to accelerate the “time to science”. 

The BoF attendees will help develop an international “community of practice” to share experiences in developing quality software, gathering community feedback, addressing interoperability, and promoting software to applications developers and users. 

We will identify strategies for ongoing efforts to inform, engage, and benefit the community and thereby advance the HPC software ecosystem.
