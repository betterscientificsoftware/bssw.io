### Abstract
<p>As computational mathematics, science, and engineering problems become larger, more ambitious, and more complex, it is increasingly important to develop and use tools and techniques that ensure that computational research is based on a strong foundation of general, low-level scientific best practices. In this webinar, the speaker will relate his experience of transitioning from working in the worlds of experimental and observational sciences to the world of computational sciences as well as his experience adapting experimental tools and techniques to computational research. In particular, the speaker will focus on the role of lab notebooks in experimental sciences and present concrete examples to address the challenges associated with adapting lab notebooks to computational research.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Jared O’Neal is a principal scientific software developer in Argonne National Laboratory’s Mathematics and Computer Science division. He currently works on computational mathematics and science applications with an eye on improving processes to ensure productivity while maintaining scientific rigor. Jared has a background in physics and mathematics and had the pleasure of working as an instrumentation and systems engineer at the Paranal Observatory overlooking Chile’s Atacama desert.</p>
