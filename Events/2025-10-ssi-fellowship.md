The SSI Fellowship Programme aims to improve and promote good computational practice across all research disciplines and support those who are doing this important work. Our Fellows have been recognised as **ambassadors of good practices** in their own domains, fields, and/or areas of work due to their dedication in promoting better software practices.

An introductory [Fellowship Programme Launch Webinar](https://forms.office.com/e/BGHuZniJ0x) will be held on Thursday 21 August, from 11:00-12:30 (BST/GMT+1). This webinar is aimed at potential applicants and will provide an overview of the programme, insights into the application process, experiences from current Fellows, and an opportunity to have your questions answered. For more information and to register, [please click here](https://forms.office.com/e/BGHuZniJ0x).

The programme is open to applicants at various career stages, including PhD candidates, junior research software engineers, early-career professionals, mid-career individuals, and senior figures such as professors and directors of research computing. We welcome diverse backgrounds, including those without formal qualifications in software development who support research, training, or research infrastructures.

We are excited to announce that the Fellowship Programme is offering up to three positions for successful international applicants. As the Institute is UK-funded, applicants not based in the UK or without formal affiliation with a UK-based institution or office must demonstrate how their plans foster international collaboration or how UK research culture benefits from their unique perspective and/or techniques.

Each year, **approximately 20 Fellows are selected**, including up to three international Fellows. Fellows receive a £4000 budget for organising or attending activities. They are **matched with Mentors** and participate in regular monthly **Community Calls** and the annual **Collaborations Workshop**. Additional opportunities within the SSI include involvement in steering committees, as well as participating in study or focus groups. Once Fellows’ inaugural periods end,  Fellows remain an active part of the community as continuing Fellows: **Once a Fellow, always a Fellow**.

The **application process** includes an application form covering personal details, professional background, software expertise, funding sources, and the key Fellowship plans. Applicants must also create a six-minute voiceover slide presentation screencast. Shortlisted candidates participate in the Online Selection Day, where they are assessed on collaboration, communication, and contribution skills. Final selection is based on performance during this day and the Fellowship plans.

Prospective applicants can access **resources and support** through the [Fellowship Programme page](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme) and the [application page](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme/apply-fellowship-programme), including eligibility criteria, video screencasts from previous Fellows, and an Application Video Guide.
