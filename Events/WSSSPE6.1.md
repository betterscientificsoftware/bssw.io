WSSSPE promotes sustainable research software by addressing challenges related to the full lifecycle of research software through shared learning and community action.

**Description:**  Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of research software at all levels. It is critical to address many new challenges related to the development, deployment, maintenance, and sustainability of open-use research software: the software upon which specific research results rely.  Open-use software means that the software is widely accessible (whether open source, shareware, or commercial). Research software means that the choice of software is essential to specific research results; using different software could produce different results.

[WSSSPE](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk) is an international community-driven organization that promotes sustainable research software by addressing challenges related to the full lifecycle of research software through shared learning and community action. WSSSPE6.1 is the ninth workshop convened since 2013 in an international series that provides opportunities for the community to come together to share and advance practices.

WSSSPE6.1 aims to facilitate the creation of a regional community focused on sustainable research software, by sharing and building best practice both locally and internationally. The workshop will discuss topics relevant to building a sustainable future for open-use research software and the activities that are needed to get there.  This includes discussion of practices and experiences in sustainable scientific software, with the goal of improving the quality of todayâ€™s research software and the experiences of its developers by sharing practices and experiences.  

WSSSPE6.1 is held in conjunction with the 2018 IEEE International Conference on eScience.
