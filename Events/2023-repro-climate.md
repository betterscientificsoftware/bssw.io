Topics of interest include but not limited to:

* Tools and approaches for software testing, debugging, quality assurance, and continuous integration.
* Statistical and ensemble-based approaches for evaluating model consistency and software correctness.
* Software design approaches and development practices for streamlining correctness and reproducibility efforts.
* Formal methods, abstraction, and logical proof techniques for rigorous verification.
* Verifying and validating large-scale applications running on HPC clusters, cloud computing systems, heterogeneous systems, GPUs, etc.
* Other software correctness and reproducibility approaches for facilitating verification and validation.

Submissions may include technical results, approaches, experiences, and opinions involving one or more of the above topics applied to:

* Climate and weather simulation codes such as drivers, couplers, frameworks, and model components.
* External libraries and packages used in climate and weather simulation applications.
* Artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, applied to climate and weather software.
* Diagnostics, post-processing, visualization tools, and libraries.
* Packaging, environment management, version control, and porting techniques for facilitating reproducibility.
* Other software development and approaches extensively used within the climate and weather simulation context.
