### Abstract
<p>As we head into the summer months, student internship programs are underway, albeit virtually as many of us are now working remotely in response to COVID-19 social distancing practices. Several laboratories have already onboarded interns and new team members to work remotely with geographically dispersed teams. What are some lessons learned and best practices about onboarding new hires that we can take away from this experience? In the fourth installment of this IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, we bring together several staff members of DOE laboratories, who will speak about their experiences in onboarding and mentoring new hires virtually. Topics include challenges, lessons learned, unforeseen benefits, and opportunities to look for from this experience.</p>



### Panelist Bios
<p>Helen Cademartori is the Deputy of Operations for the Computing
Sciences Area, and the Computational Research Division.  She has held
similar positions in Biosciences and the IT Division during her 13
year tenure at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Berkeley Labs).  In
her current role she oversees all business and operational aspects of
operations including Human Resources, finance, travel, conferences and
procurement, proposal development, space management and environmental
health and safety.  She is also responsible for strategic planning for
new initiatives and infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<p>Marcey Kelley is the Computing Workforce and Scholar Program Manager
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  She hires
approximately 200 students each year and worked with an LLNL team to
develop a remote scholar program for 2020.  This program was developed
in just 6 weeks and will onboard 500 students from across the U.S.</p>
<p>Jay Lofstead is is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the
Scalable System Software department of the Center for Computing
Research in Albuquerque, NM. His work focuses on infrastructure to
support all varieties of simulation, scientific, and engineering
workflows with a strong emphasis on IO, middleware, storage,
transactions, operating system features to support workflows,
containers, software engineering and reproducibility. He is co-founder
of the IO-500 storage list. He also works extensively to support
various student mentoring and diversity programs at several venues
each year including outreach to both high school and college
students. Jay graduated with a BS, MS, and PhD in Computer Science
from Georgia Institute of Technology and was a recipient of a 2013 R&amp;D
100 award for his work on the ADIOS IO library.</p>

<p>Bethany (Beth) Mccormick is currently the director of strategic
workforce development for the Engineering Directorate at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  Since joining LLNL in 2006,
Beth has become known as a leader in STEM education and career
development throughout the Bay Area and the country. Beth is
responsible for Engineering’s student programs, university
relationships, employee engagement and diversity and inclusion
programs.  Beth recently helped lead the transition of LLNL’s summer
internship program to a virtual program which included teaching
mentors how to manage remotely.</p>
<p>Raj Sankaran is a member of the technical staff at Argonne National
Laboratory. Through his research pursuits through Argonne and
Northwestern University, Raj collaborates closely with Environmental,
Urban, High-Performance Computing and Weather/Climate researchers. Raj
co-leads the Waggle Edge-Computing research platform and over the past
9 years, he has supervised/co-supervised over 50 graduate,
undergraduate and high-school students through summer internships and
graduate study programs. This year, the Waggle team has over half a
dozen graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students across various
programs (Research Aide, REU, SULI, and Student Visitor) participating
in remote internships on both software based research projects and
also projects involving physical hardware and sensors.</p>

    


### Moderator Bios
<p>Ashley Barker is the Group Leader for the User Assistance and Outreach
(UAO) team at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF)
located at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). UAO is responsible for
facilitating access to OLCF resources, providing training,
documentation, and technical support to users, collecting and
reporting on user facility data, and acquainting the public with the
work conducted at the OLCF through scientific highlights. The OLCF
supports more than 1,200 users and 250 projects annually from a wide
spectrum of science domains. Ashley served as the National Climate
Research Center (NCRC) Project Director from 2014-2016. The NCRC
project represents a partnership between NOAA and DOE and through this
partnership, the NCRC team has delivered multiple computer systems to
NOAA, allowing the agency to advance its climate modeling and improve
our understanding of climate variability and change. Ashley is also
currently involved in the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) as the
Control Account Manager (CAM) for training and productivity.</p>
<p>Rebecca Hartman-Baker leads the User Engagement Group at NERSC, where
she is responsible for engagement with the NERSC user community to
increase user productivity via advocacy, support, training, and the
provisioning of usable computing environments. As part of this effort,
she produces a podcast, &#8220;NERSC User News&#8221;, covering topics of interest
to NERSC users, which is syndicated on iTunes, Google Play, and
more. She worked as a postdoc and then as a scientific computing
liaison in the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, and a senior
supercomputing applications specialist at the Pawsey Supercomputing
Centre before joining NERSC in 2015. Rebecca has hired several dozen
people, including students, postdocs, and staff, but until recently
had never onboarded anyone remotely. This summer she is welcoming two
new staff members and four student interns into her group.</p>
<!-- Bio for moderator 4 -->
<p>Elaine Raybourn is a social scientist in the Statistics and Human
Systems Group (Applied Cognitive Science) at Sandia National
Laboratories. Her research focuses on virtual teams, software
developer productivity, and transmedia learning. She has worked
remotely for a combined total of 14 years while at Sandia National
Laboratories: from the UK as a guest researcher at British Telecom;
Germany (Fraunhofer FIT) and France (INRIA) as a Fellow of the
European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM),
and most recently from Orlando, Florida as Sandia’s Institutional PI
for the IDEAS-ECP productivity project. She leads the panel series
<em>Strategies for Working Remotely</em>.</p>
