### Abstract
<p>The Eclipse IDE is one of the most popular IDEs available, and its
support for multiple languages, particularly C, C++ and Fortran has
made it the go to IDE for scientific software development. Although an
IDE like Eclipse can provide advanced development capabilities such as
code recommendation and refactoring, these features can be difficult
to utilize for complex code bases. Other challenges, such as ease of
installation and use, reliability, and compatibility with existing
development practices also play a role. Ultimately the usefulness of
the tool is a tradeoff between the capabilities it provides and the
challenges of incorporating it into the development workflow. This
webinar will demonstrate some of the latest features available in
Eclipse that are particularly useful for scientific application
development, and examine how they can be used in a variety of
different scenarios using realistic sample codes.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Gregory Watson is a Senior Research Scientist in
the Computer Science Research Group at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. He received his Ph.D. from Monash University
in 2000. Gregoryâ€™s research interests include programming tools and
development environments for high performance and scientific
computing, software engineering practices, reproducibility, and
education and training for scientists. He is founder of the Eclipse
Parallel Tools Platform, a project that was originally started as a
collaboration between Los Alamos National Laboratory and IBM in 2004,
and that continues to be used across laboratories, academia, and
industry. He is also a founding member of the Eclipse Science Working
Group, and project leader of the Eclipse Science Top Level Project.</p>
