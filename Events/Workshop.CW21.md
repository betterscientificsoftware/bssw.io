### Collaborations Workshop 2021

The Software Sustainability Institute invites all members of the research software community to explore and discuss the themes of research software and its related issues at Collaborations Workshop 2021 (CW21). This year, CW21 participants will gain insight into the various research software topics, including FAIR Research Software, Diversity and Inclusion, and Software Sustainability and how these impact on research. It is also an ideal opportunity to form collaborations (on average, CW participants start two new collaborations by attending) and to discuss topics proposed by attendees. CW21 is a great place to network and participants will meet many of the new and existing [Software Sustainability Institute Fellows](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows?_ga=2.89454747.1030417516.1607984078-920709310.1607984078) – key ambassadors in varied research domains.

### Submissions

Mini-workshop and demo sessions offer unique opportunities for CW21 participants and sponsors to give an in-depth look at a particular tool or approach relating to research software. CW21 organizers are looking for sessions connected to one or more of the CW21 themes - FAIR Research Software, Diversity and Inclusion, and Software Sustainability - in particular, but are happy to consider any proposals involving research software. Proposals can also be related to pitches for the CW21 Hack Day.

CW21 is also calling for submissions for participant-led social activities to take place during their social programme! Ideas can include a networking or social activity, a board game night, a yoga or mediation session, a Bird of a Feather session, or any other suggestions.
