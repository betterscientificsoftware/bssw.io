### Abstract
<p>Working remotely has suddenly become a near-universal experience for
staff members of research organizations, but for some it has been a
way of life for years.  In this panel discussion, we brought together
five staff members of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories,
all members of the DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP), with years of
varied experience working remotely.  Topics included advice to people
just getting started with working remotely, challenges, unforeseen
benefits, and opportunities to look for from this experience, with
emphasis on issues faced by collaborating teams in computational
research.  Panelists made brief introductory comments followed by open
discussion.</p>



### Panelist Bios
<p>Mike Bernhardt started the Bernhardt Agency in 1994, focused on
helping companies in the HPC market segment. After less than a year of
running the agency from an office in downtown Portland, and dealing
with the frustration of parking, commuter traffic, and the rising cost
of office space, he decided to take the company virtual.  He ran this
agency, and two subsequent agencies as virtual organizations for 19
years, eventually employing more than 25 full-time employees working
from their homes offering communications services to companies
throughout the HPC ecosystem in North America.  In 2001, 2002, and
2003, his [virtual] agency was named the top marketing agency to work
for by Oregon Business magazine, and in 2003 it took top honors as the
#1 small business to work for in Oregon.  Mike currently leads
communications and outreach for ECP.</p>
<p>Lois Curfman McInnes is a senior computational scientist in the
Mathematics and Computer Science Division of Argonne National
Laboratory.  After working primarily onsite at Argonne during
1993-2000, she has been working remotely for 20 years, currently in
Rockville, Maryland and previously in Austin, Texas.  Lois is
presently the deputy director of software technology for ECP.</p>
<p>Mark Miller, a software developer at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory supporting HPC visualization tools, has worked remotely,
part-time, for 10+ years from Davis, CA.  His home office setting
involves only his wife (no children or pets), a separate room for an
office, an LLNL provided laptop and peripherals and Comcast/Xfinity’s
lowest tier internet service plus Verizon hot-spot with 8Gb/mo data
limit.  Mark is a member of the IDEAS-ECP productivity project.</p>
<p>Kathryn Mohror is a computer scientist and group leader in the Center
for Applied Scientific Computing Division of Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory. She has been working remotely from Portland,
Oregon for 10 years in her current position and about 10 years before
that while in school.  Kathryn is presently co-PI of the ECP project
ExaIO.</p>
<p>Elaine Raybourn is a social scientist who has worked remotely for a
combined total of 14 years while at Sandia National Laboratories: from
the UK as a guest researcher at British Telecom; Germany and France as
a Fellow of the European Research Consortium in Informatics and
Mathematics (ERCIM), and most recently from Orlando, Florida as a
member of Sandia’s Statistics and Human Systems Group and the
IDEAS-ECP productivity project.</p>

    


### Moderator Bios
<!-- Bio for panel 1 -->
<p>Mike Heroux has worked remotely for nearly 23 years from rural central
Minnesota, briefly as Director of Applications at SGI/Cray, then as a
staff member in the Center for Computing Research at Sandia National
Laboratories. Mike is presently the director of software technology
for ECP and a Scientist in Residence at St. John’s University, MN.</p>
