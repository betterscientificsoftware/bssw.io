This event is a part of the "Best Practices for HPC Software
Developers" webinar series, produced by the IDEAS Productivity
Project. The HPC Best Practices webinars address issues faced by
developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on
high-performance computers (HPC) and occur approximately monthly.

### Abstract
<p>Over the past two decades, the emergence of highly effective software
testing frameworks has greatly simplified the development and use of
unit tests and has led to new software development paradigms such as
test driven development (TDD). However, technical computing introduces
a number of unique testing challenges, including distributed
parallelism and numerical accuracy. This webinar will begin with a
basic introduction to the use of pFUnit to develop tests for
MPI+Fortran software and then present some of the new capabilities in
the latest release. We will also discuss some specialized
methodologies for testing numerical algorithms and speculate about
future framework capabilities that may improve our ability to test at
exascale.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Dr. Thomas Clune currently serves as the
Lead for the Software Integration Team within the Global Modeling and
Assimilation Office at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and also as
NASA’s representative on the Fortran Standards Committee.  Much of his
recent activities have been focused on leveraging object-oriented
features of modern Fortran to provide Fortran developers with analogs
of useful capabilities available in other software communities.  His
open source projects include pFUnit (parallel unit testing for
Fortran), gFTL (poor-man’s container templates for Fortran), fArgParse
(command line processing), and pFlogger (an MPI-enhanced analog of
Python’s logging package).</p>
