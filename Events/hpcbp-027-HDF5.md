### Abstract
<p>HDF5 is a data model, file format, and I/O library that has become a
de facto standard for HPC applications to achieve scalable I/O and for
storing and managing big data from computer modeling, large physics
experiments and observations. This webinar will give an introduction
to using the HDF5 library, with a focus on parallel I/O and
performance tuning options. The webinar will also provide an overview
of the latest performance and productivity enhancement features being
developed as part of the DOEâ€™s Exascale Computing Project (ECP)
ExaHDF5 effort, and will present optimizations used in improving I/O
performance of ECP applications.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Quincey Koziol is a Principal Data Architect in the
National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is responsible for helping
to build the software infrastructure that is needed to enable
scientists to process, analyze, manage and share data at the highest
scales.</p>
