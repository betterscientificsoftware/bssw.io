### NAIRR Portal - NSF-funded SGX3 requests your input

The [National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR)](https://new.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr) is set to revolutionize AI research accessibility in the United States. A key part of this vision is the NAIRR Portal, a central hub connecting researchers, educators, and students with crucial AI resources.

The [SGX3](https://sciencegateways.org/) – The Center of Excellence for Science Gateways - provides the NAIRR Pilot Portal and leads the effort on gathering contributions to the vision of a NAIRR Portal:

- Take the [NAIRR Portal User Survey](https://ucsd.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3BFOSCNgoaspZUG?Source=DirectEmail)
- Share your valuable insights in focus groups by emailing SGX3 at help@sciencegateways.org
- Share your interest in the in-person workshop February 4-5, 2025 in San Diego by completing the [NAIRR Portal Workshop Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKp9qkdVqW2vPA1n4vjRYTArqcbYOjKUx-TIA3OIXFG9-MnA/viewform) and indicating whether you’ll need travel support.

### FAIR principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS) 2-year review

Do you think the [FAIR principles for Research Software](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068) are working?

2+ years after publishing, with over 500 people involved, we’re keen to understand if the FAIR principles have been useful & usable. If not, we’re asking the community what needs changing to make them work.

Survey: <https://forms.gle/sRhRQD4gWBQWzcGS7>

Webinars about the review process:

1.	Nov 25, 2024, 9 am ET / 8 am CT / 7 am MT / 6 am PT - <https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYkduiurTIvE9QYmlH6qg51h-SSoyprzUef>

### A Survey on refactoring practices in the development of scientific software

The FORCOLAB at the University of Toronto (UofT)is conducting a research study on understanding the refactoring practices and challenges in open-source scientific software. The main objective is to better support refactoring tasks during scientific software development. Please share your refactoring experiences in open-source scientific software by [completing this survey](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=JsKqeAMvTUuQN7RtVsVSEDG3WKvjM4pHu7QCZXS8hkhUNFVWQTA1RDIzNkZYSjNDMzNSM1VSVjVPMi4u).

### Survey on software environments for heliophysics

For RSEs in helio/solar physics– IHDEA (International Heliophysics Data Environment Alliance) has formed a working group to define common heliophysics tools/software in python which the community may one day be able to use and base their software off of. They are collecting some initial feedback about the kinds of software folks in the community are using using this short survey: <https://forms.gle/DumtthpGytnhWpCk6>.

### Center for Open-Source Research Software Stewardship and Advancement (CORSA)

The [DOE-funded CORSA project](https://corsa.center/) has been collecting [guidance, documents, examples, templates for open-source software projects, such as on governance, roadmaps, contributing, code of conduct, DEI, licenses, etc.](https://github.com/corsa-center/oss-documents/blob/main/README.md) Please feel free to add additional items, as PRs or new issues.

### Survey on generative AI for scientific software development

Dr. Elle O’Brien at the University of Michigan will be [conducting studies](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1_p82Rglu6r4cTIvms823SuCvb81ygWBBRWvhdLP6eyV4nQ/viewform) about how scientists are using generative AI tools as part of their scientific software development.

### Survey to understand mentorship needs

Dr. Reed Milewicz from Sandia National Laboratories is conducting a [survey on mentorship](https://snl-survey.sandia.gov/surveys/mentorship-survey-usrse). The survey takes 10-15 minutes to complete.

### Survey to better understand code review practices of RSEs

Dr. Jeffrey Carver, Dr. Nasir Eisty, and Md Ariful Malik of the University of Alabama are conducting a study to understand the practices, impacts and barriers of code review techniques for RSEs.
