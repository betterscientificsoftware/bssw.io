### Abstract
<p>Many teams have been working remotely for several months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, teams were largely co-located and comfortable that way – <em>they just seemed to tick</em>. Now that teams have become fully virtual and can no longer rely on productivity practices driven by being face-to-face, how have they managed change? What personal challenges have they faced, and how are they bringing back into balance team dynamics, and individual well-being? What are they learning about themselves and each other that has been unexpected? In the fifth installment of this IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, we bring together members of successful software teams to speak candidly about being disrupted by change and bringing their teams back into balance.</p>


    


### Moderator Bios
<p>Angela Herring is a staff scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. She specializes in leading multi-disciplinary, Agile
research teams. Currently, she leads two research software teams. One
team develops the remap software, Portage
(www.github.com/laristra/portage) as well as an interface
reconstruction library, Tangram (www.github.com/laristra/tangram). The
other team, Lynx, focuses on applications of code to code
linking. Angela received a M.S. in Mechanical and Aeronautical
Engineering from U.C. Davis in 2005 and a B.S. in Aerospace
Engineering from Mississippi State University in 2003.</p>
