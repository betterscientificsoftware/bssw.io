### Abstract
<p>While working remotely is challenging enough, many are currently
experiencing unique complexities involved with parenting,
transitioning to online school at home, and working productively while
practicing social distancing in response to COVID-19.  In the second
installment of the IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, we brought
together four ECP staff members, a new staff member on-boarding with a
National Lab, and a Montessori educator to share ideas and resources.</p>



### Panelist Bios
<p>Katherine Evans is the division director for the computational
sciences and engineering division at ORNL. Performing this job when
working remotely during a pandemic in a house with a high school
senior, college senior, and fellow scientist/manager/husband Tom (see
bio below) requires staking out the quietest room in the house to
perform a range of calls. On these calls, she attempts to assure her
staff that its ok to let the kids cry in the background and asks for
clarity from her management to guide her through the unforeseen
logistical issues for 100 people to work remotely and 20 staff to risk
their health to continue their work onsite.  During this exercise, Tom
and the kids also have many online meetings/classes/gaming and she
thanks herself daily that her husband Tom successfully argued to
upgrade the family internet to 100Gb fiber just last year. The beagle
enjoys the new family schedule and has learned that the kids give in
to the cute dog face so she now eats about 10 times a day.</p>
<p>Thomas Evans leads work at ORNL on energy applications in ECP.  He is
working remotely during a pandemic in a house with a high school
senior, college senior, and fellow scientist/manager/wife Kate (see
bio above).</p>
<p>Madeline Heroux is an educator with experience tutoring junior high,
high school and college students in the US and Japan.  She is
presently at Step-by-Step Montessori school in Minneapolis, MN,
working with young children. Her most recent efforts are focused on
the transition from in-person to remote learning.  In what can seem
like an impossible challenge at times, she has been working closely
with parents and children alike to form schedules, activities, and
structure that works best for them.</p>
<p>Lindsey Hughes just transitioned to a systems engineer role supporting
the W80-4. She and her husband have worked at Sandia National
Laboratories for 10 years. She is currently working a part time
schedule primarily from home. She has three kids under the age of six
and two dogs keeping things interesting in the background. Her husband
is working full time from the home as well. Lindsey has served as
board member for the Sandia Parents Group for 3 years.</p>
<p>Stefan Wild, from the Laboratory for Applied Mathematics, Numerical
Software, and Statistics (LANS) at Argonne National Laboratory, has
lost track of the number of weeks since daycare, kindergarten, and two
offices moved under one roof.</p>

    


### Moderator Bios
<p>Ashley Barker is the Group Leader for the User Assistance and Outreach
(UAO) team at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF)
located at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). UAO is responsible for
facilitating access to OLCF resources, providing training,
documentation, and technical support to users, collecting and
reporting on user facility data, and acquainting the public with the
work conducted at the OLCF through scientific highlights. The OLCF
supports more than 1,200 users and 250 projects annually from a wide
spectrum of science domains. Ashley served as the National Climate
Research Center (NCRC) Project Director from 2014-2016. The NCRC
project represents a partnership between NOAA and DOE and through this
partnership, the NCRC team has delivered multiple computer systems to
NOAA, allowing the agency to advance its climate modeling and improve
our understanding of climate variability and change. Ashley is also
currently involved in the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) as the
Control Account Manager (CAM) for training and productivity.</p>
<p>Elaine Raybourn is a social scientist who has worked remotely for a
combined total of 14 years while at Sandia National Laboratories: from
the UK as a guest researcher at British Telecom; Germany (FhG FIT) and
France (INRIA) as a Fellow of the European Research Consortium in
Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), and most recently from Orlando,
Florida as a member of Sandia’s Statistics and Human Systems Group
(Applied Cognitive Science) and the IDEAS-ECP productivity project.</p>
