A tutorial on optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications will be offered from 12:30 PM-2:30 PM CST on June 12-June 14, 2023. The tutorial will include a high-level overview of the general strategies for optimizing I/O for improving code performance and will cover topics and examples related to parallel filesystems (Lustre), MPI I/O, and I/O in the context of checkpointing and AI. Hands-on exercises and demos will be included in the tutorial. 

Prerequisites: Familiarity with Linux, C/C++ programming and basic MPI. A brief overview of the related basic concepts will be included in the tutorial where needed. Additionally, participants will need to have accounts on the HPC platforms of their interest if they need to run any examples or hands-on exercises.


### Target Audience

The target audience of this tutorial includes those who are engaged in scientific software development but do not have prior experience with parallel filesystems, MPI I/O, and application-level checkpointing. AI application developers who work with Tensorflow and PyTorch and are interested in learning about checkpointing as a workaround for time-limits on job queues on HPC platforms and in creating a workflow of dependent jobs would also find this tutorial as useful (especially, on June 14th, 2023).

### Topics/Agenda

The tutorial will run approximately for two hours on each of the training days and will focus on topics such as strategies and practices for reducing the inefficient I/O in serial and parallel applications, including AI frameworks, parallel filesystems (Lustre), MPI I/O and checkpointing serial and parallel applications

### Eligibility

This free tutorial is open to all those who are interested in learning about optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications.
