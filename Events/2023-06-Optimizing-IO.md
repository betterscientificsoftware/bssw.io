A tutorial on optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications will be offered from 12:30 PM-2:30 PM CST on June 12-June 14, 2023. 
The tutorial will include a high-level overview of the general strategies for optimizing I/O for improving code performance and will cover topics and examples related to parallel filesystems (Lustre), MPI I/O, and I/O in the context of checkpointing and AI. Hands-on exercises and demos will be included in the tutorial. 

Prerequisites: Familiarity with Linux, C/C++ programming and basic MPI. 
A brief overview of the related basic concepts will be included in the tutorial where needed. 
Additionally, participants will need to have accounts on the HPC platforms of their interest if they need to run any examples or hands-on exercises.


### Target Audience
The target audience for this tutorial primarily consists of individuals involved in scientific software development, particularly those who do not have prior experience with parallel filesystems, MPI I/O, and application-level checkpointing. 
Additionally, AI application developers working with frameworks such as Tensorflow and PyTorch would also benefit from this tutorial. 
Specifically, those interested in learning about checkpointing as a solution for time-limits on job queues on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and creating workflows with dependent jobs would find the tutorial particularly useful.

### Topics/Agenda
The tutorial is expected to run for approximately two hours on each of the training days. 
It will focus on various topics, including strategies and practices for reducing inefficient I/O in both serial and parallel applications. 
Some specific areas of focus will include AI frameworks, parallel filesystems (such as Lustre), MPI I/O, and checkpointing for both serial and parallel applications.

### Eligibility

This free tutorial is open to all those who are interested in learning about optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications.
