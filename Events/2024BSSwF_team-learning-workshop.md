The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts across disciplines and domains to develop an open knowledge base with tools to support and evaluate team learning in the interdisciplinary teams who produce scientific software.

These teams are created with the goal of solving complex problems necessitating the integration of varied expertise and perspectives. Team learning is thus a key process for their effectiveness but facilitating it remains a challenge. 

The products of the workshop will contribute to understanding of and research on team learning in scientific software development.

Prospective participants are encouraged to complete the interest form. Anyone involved or interested in scientific software and team science is welcome to attend.


#### Possible topics include (but are not limited to):

* Drivers of Integrative Learning in Software Teams
* Knowledge Demonstrability for Team Learning
* Learning to Learn: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Cognition
* Communication Across Disciplinary Boundaries
* Inclusive Learning: Antecedents and Strategies
* Team Heterogeneity and Social Harmony

Invitees will be asked to submit a short position paper (no more than 2 pages) prior to the workshop. Workshop activities will include invited speaker talks, breakout sessions to develop materials, and networking opportunities.

Workshop products will be made publicly available via a GitHub repo, and participants may have the opportunity to publish in a special issue or edited volume (TBD).


Travel, lodging, and meals for the workshop will be covered by the organizer for approximately 20 invited participants. Limited space for self-funded participants is available. 

Early-career individuals and members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in STEM are highly encouraged to submit to this event.

Please refer to the event website for up-to-date information.
