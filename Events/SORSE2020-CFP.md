Were you going to submit something to an RSE conference this year? Do you have a project you’d like to share? Is there a talk/workshop/panel you’d like to see happen? Then you’ve found the right place!

With the cancellation of several international Research Software Engineering (RSE) community events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, RSEs worldwide are facing a lack of opportunities to engage with their wider community. To address this challenge, SORSE has been launched by an international committee to provide an opportunity for RSEs to develop and grow their skills, build new collaborations and engage with RSEs worldwide. Until we can meet again in person, SORSE (pronounced "Source"), will bridge the gap and be the source of interesting and engaging events.
   
This is an open call to all RSEs and anyone involved with research software, worldwide, to propose talks, workshops and other types of online events.
   
The Call for Contributions form will remain open continuously and there will be a rolling deadline at the end of the last day (UTC) of each month, following which all contributions received over the previous month will be sent for review by the Programme Committee.
