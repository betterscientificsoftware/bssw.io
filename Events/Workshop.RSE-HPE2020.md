The *Research Software Engineers in HPC (RSE-HPC-2020)* workshop's motto is to create communities, build careers, and address challenges. In 2020. this workshop is to be held in conjunction with [Supercomputing 2020](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/) and it will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world. The focus will be to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. Workshop attendees will discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and write a report on ways RSE organizations can help address these.

### Description
The workshop organizers encourage prospective participants to submit position papers (limit of 2 pages, not counting references; no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues, including (but not limited to):

* Career paths: how do RSEs want to be hired, promoted and evaluated?
* Building RSE organizations: how to find RSEs in your country/region and how to motivate them to join the network and engage?
* Supporting RSE organizations: what can be done to help RSEs (and those supporting RSEs) at international, national, regional, and local levels?
* Making the business case for RSEs and RSE groups: evidence, case studies, tactics?
* How do we want funders to support RSE roles and activities?
* Building in RSE requirements as part of wider research infrastructure
* Providing mentoring and training for RSEs

These papers will not be part of the Supercomputing 2020 proceedings, but will be made available to workshop participants prior to the workshop. Some submitters will be invited to present their papers at the workshop as lightning talks or to participate as panelists where appropriate.

The workshop organizers also welcome proposals for discussion topics. Proposals should consist of a short paragraph describing a problem or issue relevant to RSEs that could be useful to discuss in the workshop. Some of these proposals will be chosen to guide the two discussion sessions in the program. Submissions from first-time conference presenters, and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the HPC community are highly encouraged.
