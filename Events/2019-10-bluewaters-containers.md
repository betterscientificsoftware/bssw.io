### Abstract
Containers make it possible for scientists and engineers to easily use portable and reproducible software environments. However, if the desired application is not already available from a container registry, generating a custom container image from scratch can be challenging for users accustomed to a bare metal software environment. HPC Container Maker (HPCCM) is an open source project to address these challenges. HPCCM provides a high level, configurable Python recipe format for deploying HPC components into container images according to best practices. HPCCM recipes are more portable and powerful than native container specification formats, easier to create, and produce smaller, well-constructed container images.

### Presenter Bio
Scott McMillan is a Senior Solutions Architect at NVIDIA where he works on high performance computing. One of his interests is making HPC more accessible. Scott holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Northwestern University.
