### Abstract
<p>High performance computing has transformed how science and engineering
research is conducted.  Answering a question in 30 minutes that used
to take 6 months can quickly change the way one asks questions.  Large
computing facilities provide access to some of the worldâ€™s largest
computing, data, and network resources in the world.  Indeed, the DOE
complex has the highest concentration of supercomputing capability in
the world.  However, by nature of their existence, making use of the
largest computers in the world can be a challenging and unique
task. This talk will discuss how supercomputers are unique and explain
how that impacts their use.</p>
