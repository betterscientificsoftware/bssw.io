### Abstract
<p>Software is a necessary by-product of research. Software in this
context can range from small shell scripts to complex and layered
software ecosystems. Dealing with software as a first class citizen at
the time of grant formulation is aided by the development of a
Software Management Plan (SMP). An SMP can help to formalize a set of
structures and goals that ensure your software is accessible and
reusable in the short, medium and long term. SMP’s aim at becoming for
software what Data Management Plans (DMP’s) have become for research
data (DMP’s are mandatory for National Science Foundation
grants). This webinar takes you through the questions you should
consider when developing a Software Management Plan, how to manage the
implementation of the plan, and some of the current motivation driving
discussion in this area of research management.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Shoaib Sufi leads the Software
Sustainability Institute&#8217;s community engagement activities and
strategies. Graduating in Computer Science from the University of
Manchester in 1997, he has worked in the commercial sector as a
systems programmer and then as a software developer, metadata
architect and eventually a project manager at the Science and
Facilities Technologies Council (STFC).</p>

<p>Shoaib has specific interest in building, managing and sustaining
high-performance teams, distributed agile project management and the
promotion of technical best practice in software products for use in
research. He is a project manager by practice and training (holding a
PMI PMP), and also serves in this capacity with the eScience Lab at
the University of Manchester.</p>

<p>His work at the Institute includes coordinating its Fellowship
Programme, a network of researchers who act as ambassadors of better
research software practice to their domains and organisations by
organising workshops related to research software and attending
relevant workshops and conferences in their areas of work. Shoaib also
leads the Institute&#8217;s annual Collaborations Workshop(CW) which brings
together researchers, developers, funders, managers and more to
explore hot topics in research software all within an engaging
unconference inspired format.</p>
