Ensuring correctness in high-performance computing (HPC) applications is one of the fundamental challenges that the HPC community faces today. The Sixth International Workshop on Software Correctness for HPC Applications will be held in conjunction with the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC22).

This year's workshop will include, but is not limited to, the following topics: 
* Correctness in Scientific Applications and Algorithms
* Tools for Debugging, Testing, and Correctness Checking
* Programming Models and Runtime Systems Correctness
* Other Areas

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in English structured as technical or experience papers at a length of at least 6 pages but not exceeding 8 pages of content, including everything. Submissions must use the IEEE format. More information on the workshop topics and paper submissions can be found on the event website.
