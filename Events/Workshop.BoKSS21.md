### Theme and Goals

With the pervasive role of software and digitalization in all aspects of contemporary society, the topic of sustainability is becoming increasingly important and increasingly urgent for software engineers and software engineering education. But currently, there is a scant foundation of practices, examples, tools, datasets, guidelines etc. upon which to make principled engineering decisions and upon which to build a curriculum. In spite of the active international research community in the field, there is no strong foundation of significant and reusable results upon which to build tangible progress that helps contribute to the target sustainability goals.

BoKSS 2021 seeks contributions addressing practices for: software sustainability; metrics and measures for software sustainability; applied, or experimented with, software engineering methodologies at all levels (from requirements elicitation to architecture design, coding, testing); patterns and anti-patterns and/or; architectural tactics, architectural styles and design patterns.

The goal of BoKSS 2021 is to create such a knowledge base. It seeks to create a knowledge base of actionable results that will transform sustainable software engineering practices from a novel research area into a robust, repeatable, teachable practice area within software engineering.

In addition to the knowledge base mentioned above, the envisaged workshop outcomes include forming a concrete work-force that will create (i) an online platform to share the knowledge base, and (ii) a scientific report targeting journal publication which will present the Body of Knowledge for Sustainability in Software Engineering (BoKSS) as a unified theory. Depending on the number of participants and contributions, there may be more than one report resulting from this workshop.

### Submission Guidelines
Prospective participants are invited to submit two types of contributions:  (1) Full papers (max 8 pages), (2) Extended abstracts (max 2 pages). Both types of contributions have to follow a well-defined structure, which can be found on the workshop website.
  
Workshop papers will use a single blind submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.
