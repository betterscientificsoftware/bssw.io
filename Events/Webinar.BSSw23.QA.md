The [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship) provides recognition and funding for leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software who foster practices, processes, and tools to improve scientific software productivity and sustainability. 
BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software. 
We select at least three Fellows per year and honorable mentions as appropriate. 
Each 2023 BSSw Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software. 
Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.
