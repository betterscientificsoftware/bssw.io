The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms and tools with a strong focus on practical solutions and challenges. eScience 2025 interprets eScience in its broadest meaning that enables and improves innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all domain sciences ranging from traditional areas in physics and earth sciences to more recent fields such as social sciences, arts and humanities, and artificial intelligence for a wide variety of target architectures including HPC, cloud and IoT infrastructures.

The 21st IEEE International Conference on e-Science is co-located with the [6th Global Research Platform Workshop](https://www.theglobalresearchplatform.net/) (6GRP). Both audiences share common interests, content, and culture. Co-location provides attendees with the option to register for both events.
