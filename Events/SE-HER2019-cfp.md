Paper submissions are open for the 2019 International Workshop on Software Engineering for HPC-Enabled Research (SE-HER 2019), to be held on Sunday, November 17, in conjunction with SC'19 in Denver, CO.  The deadline is August 16.

The 2019 International Workshop on Software Engineering for HPC-Enabled Research (SE-HER 2019), to be held on Sunday, November 17, in conjunction with SC'19 in Denver, CO, is concerned with identifying and applying appropriate software engineering (SE) tools and practices (e.g., code generators, static analyzers, validation & verification (V&V) practices, testing, design approaches, and maintenance practices) to support and ease the development of reproducible High Performance Computing (HPC, e.g., large parallel models/simulations) & Data Analysis/Analytics (HPDA, e.g. large data analyses).

Despite the increasing demand for utilizing HPC for such applications, software development for HPC historically attracted little attention from the SE community, while paradoxically, the HPC and HPDA communities have increasingly been adopting SE techniques and tools. Indeed, the development of HPC and HPDA software differs significantly from the development of more traditional business information systems from which many SE best practices and tools have been drawn. While those practices and tools provide a starting point, the HPC and HPDA communities will be better served with tools and practices that are more cognizant of their needs.  

We encourage submission of full papers (up to 8 pages) on issues including but not limited to:
- Case studies of both successes and/or failures in applying SE tools and practices to HPC or HPDA software, with sufficient analysis that leads workshop attendees to learn something more general than just the specific case study;
- Measures of software development productivity appropriate to HPC or HPDA applications;
- Lessons learned from HPC or HPDA applications throughout the product lifecycle, from research and development to design, analysis, construction, testing, deployment, continuous integration, and maintenance of software;
- SE techniques and tools appropriate for the current range of HPC/HPDA platforms and frameworks;
- SE metrics and tool support for HPC and HPDA applications;
- Empirical studies that help researchers better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes used in software development on HPC platforms and how they might be improved; and
- V&V techniques target specifically for the HPC or HPDA domains.

We also encourage submission of two types of shorter (up to 4 page papers) that will not appear in the proceedings, but will be made available to participants prior to the workshop:
- Position papers that state opinions or positions, not necessarily finalized research
- Work in progress papers that allow authors to present very early results and challenges to gain feedback or to present tools and practices under development 

We especially encourage members of the HPC and HPDA communities to submit practical experience papers. Papers on other related topics are also welcome; please contact the organizers with any questions about the relevance of particular topics.
