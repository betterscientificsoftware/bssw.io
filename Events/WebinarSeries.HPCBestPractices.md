# Best Practices for HPC Software Developers Webinar Series

- Organizers: The [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
- Dates: May 4, 2016 - Dec 31, 2019
- Location: Online
- Event Website: https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/

The HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) webinars address issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers (HPC). 

Webinars are scheduled on roughly a monthly basis and are available live and then archived for future reference. The event web site provides details about the webinar series, including announcements of upcoming webinars, a mailing list to receive announcements, and archival information for the entire series.

**Webinars are free and open to the public, but advance registration is required (individually, for each session).**

## Next webinar: Tools and Techniques for Floating-Point Analysis

### Date and Time: Wednesday, October 16, 2019, 1:00-2:00 pm ET 
### Presenter: Ignacio Laguna, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
### Description: 
Scientific software is central to the practice of research computing. While software is widely used in many science and engineering disciplines to simulate real-world phenomena, developing accurate and reliable scientific software is notoriously difficult. One of the most serious difficulties comes from dealing with floating-point arithmetic to perform numerical computations. Round-off errors occur and accumulate at all levels of computation, while compiler optimizations and low-precision arithmetic can significantly affect the final computational results. With accelerators such as GPUs dominating high-performance computing systems, computational scientists are faced with even bigger challenges, given that ensuring numerical reproducibility in these systems poses a very difficult problem. This webinar provides highlights from a half-day tutorial discussing tools that are available today to analyze floating-point scientific software. We focus on tools that allow programmers to get insight about how different aspects of floating-point arithmetic affect their code and how to fix potential bugs.
