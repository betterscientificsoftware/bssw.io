# Best Practices for HPC Software Developers Webinar Series

- Organizers: The [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
- Dates: May 4, 2016 - Dec 31, 2019
- Location: Online
- Event Website: https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/

The HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) webinars address issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers (HPC). 

Webinars are scheduled on roughly a monthly basis and are available live and then archived for future reference. The event web site provides details about the webinar series, including announcements of upcoming webinars, a mailing list to receive announcements, and archival information for the entire series.

**Webinars are free and open to the public, but advance registration is required (individually, for each session).**

## Next webinar: Modern C++ for High-Performance Computing

### Date and Time: Wednesday, June 12, 2019, 1:00-2:00 pm ET
### Presenter: Andrew Lumsdaine, PNNL and University of Washington
### Description:
Since its creation by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ has steadily evolved to become a multi-paradigm programming language that fully supports the needs of modern programmers. Because C++ had its roots in the C programming language, conventional wisdom (and longstanding practice) had been to use C++ in a dichotomous fashion: abstractions for productivity with escape to C for performance. However, C++ today is best viewed holistically — as it is today — rather than as extension of C or even of earlier versions of C++. In this webinar I will give a tour of features from modern C++ relevant to HPC, along with guidelines for their use — and demonstrate that C++ can offer productivity and elegance while sacrificing nothing in performance.
