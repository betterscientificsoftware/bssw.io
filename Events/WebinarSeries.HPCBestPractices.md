# Best Practices for HPC Software Developers Webinar Series

- Organizers: The [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
- Dates: May 4, 2016 - Dec 31, 2019
- Location: Online
- Event Website: https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/

The HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) webinars address issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers (HPC). 

Webinars are scheduled on roughly a monthly basis and are available live and then archived for future reference. The event web site provides details about the webinar series, including announcements of upcoming webinars, a mailing list to receive announcements, and archival information for the entire series.

**Webinars are free and open to the public, but advance registration is required (individually, for each session).**

## Next webinar: So, You Want to Be Agile? Strategies for Introducing Agility into Your Scientific Software Project

### Date and Time: Wednesday, May 8, 2019, 1:00-2:00 pm ET
### Presenter: Mike Heroux (SNL)
### Description:
Scientific software team cultures have natural consistencies with agile practices. Discovery-driven development, a focus on regular delivery of results, in-person discussions within and across research teams, and a focus on long-term sustainable research programs are commonplace dynamics on computational science teams that develop software. These dynamics are also particular expressions of core agile principles.

Many scientific software teams have already assimilated industry best practices in some aspects of their work. The advent of open software development platforms such as GitHub and GitLab have accelerated awareness and adoption, as have numerous on-line resources that enable a motivated person to continue learning new ideas and approaches. Even so, we propose that a healthy team habit is continued exploration and improvement of software practices, processes and skills.

In this webinar, we discuss a few agile practices and strategies that are readily adapted and adopted by scientific software teams. In addition, we describe an attitude and strategy for continual process improvement that enables computational science teams to simultaneously deliver science results and, at the same time, dedicate a slice of time to improving software practices on their way to delivering those results.
