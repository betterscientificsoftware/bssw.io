- Organizers: The IDEAS Productivity Project
			   
This event is a part of the "Best Practices for HPC Software
Developers" webinar series, produced by the IDEAS Productivity
Project. The HPC Best Practices webinars address issues faced by
developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on
high-performance computers (HPC) and occur approximately monthly.

### Abstract
<p>Python’s powerful elegance has driven its adoption at HPC centers for
job orchestration, visualization, exploratory data analysis, and even
simulation.  But maximizing performance from Python applications can
be challenging especially on supercomputing architectures.  This
webinar will explain those challenges with a practical emphasis on
using Python at NERSC, ALCF, and OLCF.  We will outline a variety of
performance optimization strategies, tools for measuring and
addressing performance problems, and establish best practices for
Python in HPC.</p>



### Presenter Bios
<p>Rollin Thomas is a Big Data Architect in the Data and Analytics Services group. <!-- codespell:ignore rollin -->
Prior to joining NERSC in 2015, he was a Staff Scientist in the Computational Research Division.
He has worked on numerical simulations of supernova atmospheres, observation and analysis of supernova spectroscopy data, and data management for
supernova cosmology experiments.
Rollin has served as a member of the Nearby Supernova Factory, is a builder on the Dark Energy Survey, and is a full member of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Dark Energy Science Collaboration. <!-- codespell:ignore rollin -->
He holds a B.S. in physics from Purdue University and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of
Oklahoma.</p>
<p>William Scullin is an Assistant Computational
Scientist Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. He is a HPC systems
expert and computational generalist with a strong background in
systems administration who enables science through skillful
utilization of some of the largest supercomputers on Earth. He was an
active developer and evangelist of Python software and tools to
improve system and scientific productivity in HPC environments.</p>
<p>Matt Belhorn is an HPC support specialist,
providing technical support and training to researchers employing the
OLCF’s leadership-class public research compute resources. Matt has a
research background in experimental high-energy particle physics. He
was a long-time collaborator of the Belle and BelleII CP-violation
experiments located at the Japanese High-Energy Accelerator Research
Organization (KEK). His research efforts include contributions to the
design and construction of BelleII’s Imaging Time-of-Propagation
(iTOP) counter. Matt developed his interest in high-performance
computing while analyzing the physics of spontaneous
particle-antiparticle oscillations.</p>
