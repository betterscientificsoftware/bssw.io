This event is a part of the "Best Practices for HPC Software
Developers" webinar series, produced by the IDEAS Productivity
Project. The HPC Best Practices webinars address issues faced by
developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on
high-performance computers (HPC) and occur approximately monthly.

### Abstract
<p>The process of developing HPC software requires consideration of
issues in software design as well as practices that support the
collaborative writing of well-structured code that is easy to
maintain, extend, and support.  This presentation will provide an
overview of development environments and how to configure, build, and
deploy HPC software using some of the tools that are frequently used
in the community.  We will also discuss ways in which these and other
tools are best utilized by various categories of scientific software
developers, ranging from small teams (for example, a faculty member
and graduate students who are writing research code intended primarily
for their own use) through moderate/large teams (for example,
collaborating developers spread among multiple institutions who are
writing publicly distributable code intended for use by others in the
community).</p>
