The Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 2021 Computational Science and Engineering (CSE21) conference Broader Engagement (BE) program will provide a rich scientific program, mentoring, and career and professional development to students from underrepresented and underprivileged backgrounds who aspire to broaden their experience in research-based professional activities.  CSE is indispensable for leading-edge investigation and engineering design in a vast number of industrial sectors, including, for example, aerospace, automotive, biological, chemical, and semiconductor technologies that all rely increasingly on advanced modeling and simulation. Women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, first-generation scholars, and others from underprivileged backgrounds are encouraged to apply.
