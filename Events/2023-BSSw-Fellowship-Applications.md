The 2024 Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program is accepting applications during August 15 through September 29, 2023.

The BSSw Fellowship Program provides recognition and funding for leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software who foster practices, 
processes, and tools to improve scientific software productivity and sustainability. BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application 
process that includes the proposal of a funded activity which promotes better scientific software through a publicly available artifact. 
We select at least three Fellows per year and honorable mentions as appropriate. Each 2024 BSSw Fellow will receive up to $25,000 for their 
proposed activity. Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software 
community, including broadening participation or promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.
