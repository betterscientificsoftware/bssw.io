### Abstract
<p>During the last few years the Jupyter notebook has become one of the
tools of choice for the data science and high-performance computing
(HPC) communities. This webinar will provide an overview of why
Jupyter is gaining traction in education, data science, and HPC, with
emphasis on how notebooks can be used as interactive documents for
exploration and reporting.  We will present an overview of how Jupyter
works and how the network protocol can be leveraged for both a local
single machine and remote-cluster work.  We will discuss the nuts and
bolts of how Jupyter has been deployed at NERSC as a case study in
implementation of Jupyter in an HPC environment. This work implies
learning the Jupyter ecosystem to take advantage of its powerful
abstractions to develop custom infrastructure to satisfy policies and
user needs.  The webinar will show, as a use case, how Jupyter
notebooks have transformed data discovery, visualization, and
interactive analysis for the scanning probe and electron microscopy
communities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It will also show how
notebooks can seamlessly accommodate measurements from a wide variety
of instruments through Pycroscopy, a framework for instrument agnostic
data storage and analysis.</p>



### Presenter Bios
<p>Matthias Bussonnier is a Postdoctoral
Scholar at the University Of California Berkeley Institute of
Datascience. Matthias is a Co-Founder of Jupyter and Core developer of
IPython/Jupyter since 2012.  Matthias is mostly working on the core
Python component of Jupyter and the IPython kernel. He holds a PhD in
Biophysics from the Institut Curie, Paris, France.</p>
<p>Suhas Somnath is a member of the OLCF’s Advanced
Data and Workflows group and an expert in analytics for scanning probe
microscopy (SPM). As a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Nanophase
Materials Science, he was among the five scientists who developed a
fundamentally new approach towards capturing and analyzing data in SPM
which was recognized with an R&amp;D 100 award. He earned his PhD in
mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>Shreyas Cholia is a computational systems engineer
working on technologies to enhance the scientific big-data
capabilities at NERSC. He is the lead developer of NEWT, a web service
that allows you to access computing resources at NERSC. Shreyas also
shares an appointment with the Data Science and Technology department
in LBNL’s Computational Research Division. He graduated from Rice
University, double majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive
Sciences.</p>
