### Abstract
<p>Mentoring is vital to developing and retaining a diverse, talented, and enabled workforce. The first session in our Workforce Development Seminar series will feature a panel of experienced mentors drawn from High-Performance Computing (HPC) and STEM related careers, who will discuss tips for building the important mentor/mentee relationship and best practices in mentoring. They will share what they have learned from their mentees about developing, networking, and sponsoring the next generation of HPC and STEM professionals.</p>
