### Abstract
<p>Openscapes champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. In this webinar the speaker will share how she transitioned from doing her own marine ecology research to founding Openscapes to support other researchers and grow the global Open Science movement. The speaker will share lessons learned from her work mentoring government, non-profit, and academic environmental and Earth teams, with specific stories from projects with NASA and NOAA Fisheries. The webinar will reuse parts of a recent keynote at RStudio::conf that was the global launch of Quarto, a new, open-source, scientific and technical publishing system. The webinar will include a demo on some features of Quarto for R and Python users and highlight how more reusing and less reinventing is critical for science. The speaker will also discuss how open source/science is a daily practice, and an important avenue to increase inclusion in science and contribute to the climate movement.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Julia Stewart Lowndes, PhD is founding director of Openscapes. She is a marine ecologist and champion for making science more open, efficient, inclusive, and kind. Working at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science, she is a Mozilla Fellow, National Science Foundation Better Scientific Software Fellow, and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara. Julia earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. Recent open science/R contributions include pieces in Scientific American, Nature, useR! Conference 2019, RStudio::Conf 2022, R for Excel Users, and the Tidy Data Illustrated Series.</p>
