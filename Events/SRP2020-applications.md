The Sustainable Horizons Institute and Berkeley Lab invite faculty and students to apply to SRP 2020-2021. This program offers a one of a kind research experience alongside Berkeley Lab Computing Sciences staff.

The Program is intended to foster sustainable relationships between faculty, students and lab staff. Participants learn about chances to engage in collaborative, cutting-edge research with lab scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.

### Faculty Track

The program supports faculty from a variety of institutions, including minority-serving institutions, liberal arts, and community colleges, working with students such as women, minorities, first-generation scholars, and people with disabilities. Faculty who attend this workshop will learn of opportunities to participate in summer research with their students or send their students on their own.

### Student Track

The Sustainable Research Pathways 2020 Workshop is excited to announce that, due to our remarkable success and extraordinary outcomes over the past years, we are opening a Student Track for the SRP 2020 Workshop!

Therefore, if you are an undergraduate or graduate student in a computational science & engineering program at an accredited US academic institution you have two ways to apply: as part of a faculty application, or individually.
