We are organizing a minisymposterium (topical poster group) on "Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE" for the SIAM CSE21 conference, which is scheduled to take place 1-5 March 2021 and will be fully online. We welcome poster contributions for this general topic (see the draft abstract at the end of this message).

This poster group will complement a number of minisymposia which are also being organized on topics within this space.  All posters in the thematic poster group will be co-located in the poster viewing area, which will promote informal exchange of ideas on software productivity and sustainability issues. At prior conferences, we have had groups of around 30 posters each ([CSE19](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4410767), [CSE17](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3703771)).   SIAM CSE21 is committed to provide a rich environment for online poster displays; details will be provided in the coming months.

Because of the logistics of matching contributors into the correct topical groups, we first need to collect information about your poster.  Then, we’ll reply with the next steps for your submission.

You will need to provide the following information with your submissions:
* Your name and email address
* Names of any co-authors
* Poster title
  - Your title must start with “Minisymposterium:” in order to be matched into the poster group.
* Poster abstract (up to 1500 characters)

__Please be sure that the title and abstract of your poster emphasize issues in software productivity and sustainability.__

We are collecting poster proposals at this **[Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckh2wuHtcz41WZYjKe6aUx1mEWT4QdHL_aMwSYBERSrLsmlw/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. Please submit by **Wednesday 28 September 2020** so that we can follow up and you can finalize your submission.

Please note that new SIAM guidelines allow an individual to present just __***one*** talk or poster__.  If you already have a talk planned for CSE21, please encourage your co-authors or collaborators to participate in the poster group.

Best regards, David Bernholdt, Sandra Gesing, and Rinku Gupta

### Tentative Minisymposterium Information

**Title:** Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE

**Organizers:**
* David Bernholdt, Oak Ridge National Laboratory
* Sandra Gesing, University of Notre Dame
* Rinku Gupta, Argonne National Laboratory

**Abstract:** Software is the key crosscutting technology that enables advances in mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering to achieve robust simulations and analysis for predictive science, engineering, and other research fields. While software is becoming more complex due to multiphysics and multiscale modeling, the coupling of data analytics, and disruptive changes in computer hardware (due to increases in typical system scale and heterogeneity, including GPUs and additional alternative architectures), software itself has not traditionally received focused attention in the CSE community. The posters presented in this minisymposterium will address work that addresses growing technical and social challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability, and thereby helps software fulfill its critical role as a cornerstone of long-term CSE collaboration.
