<p>Scientific software is central to the practice of research computing. While software is widely used in many science and engineering disciplines to simulate real-world phenomena, developing accurate and reliable scientific software is notoriously difficult. One of the most serious difficulties comes from dealing with floating-point arithmetic to perform numerical computations. Round-off errors occur and accumulate at all levels of computation, while compiler optimizations and low-precision arithmetic can significantly affect the final computational results. With accelerators such as GPUs dominating high-performance computing systems, computational scientists are faced with even bigger challenges, given that ensuring numerical reproducibility in these systems poses a very difficult problem. This webinar provides highlights from a half-day tutorial discussing tools that are available today to analyze floating-point scientific software. We focus on tools that allow programmers to get insight about how different aspects of floating-point arithmetic affect their code and how to fix potential bugs.</p>
