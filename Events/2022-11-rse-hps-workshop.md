Research software engineers (RSEs) are critical to the impact of HPC, data science, and the larger scientific community. They have existed for decades, though often not under that name. The past several years, however, have seen the development of the RSE concept, common job titles, and career paths; the creation of professional networks to connect RSEs; and the emergence of RSE groups at universities, national laboratories, and industry.

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We’ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and brainstorm ways RSE organizations can help address these.

The workshop will be highly interactive, featuring breakout discussions and panels, as well as invited addresses and shorter talks.

## Submissions

Prospective participants are encouraged to submit position papers (limit of 2 pages, not counting references; no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues. Possible topics include (but are not limited to):

* Career paths: how do RSEs want to be hired, promoted and evaluated?
* Building RSE organizations: how to find RSEs in your country/region and how to motivate them to join the network and engage?
* Supporting RSE organizations: what can be done to help RSEs (and those supporting RSEs) at international, national, regional, and local levels?
* Making the business case for RSEs and RSE groups: evidence, case studies, tactics?
* How do we want funders to support RSE roles and activities?
* Building in RSE requirements as part of wider research infrastructure
* Providing mentoring and training for RSEs

These papers will not be part of the SC proceedings, but the authors of accepted submissions will be asked to self-publish their submissions (after revisions, if they so choose) to an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo, figshare, OSF). The RSE website will then provide links to those self-published documents. Some submitters will be invited to present their papers at the workshop as lightning talks or to participate as panelists where appropriate.

Submissions from first-time conference presenters, and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the HPC community are particularly encouraged.

Papers and discussion topics should be submitted using the [submission website](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SC22WorkshopRSEHPC2022Submission&site=sc22). The deadline for submissions is Friday, August 5, 2022, at 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12).
