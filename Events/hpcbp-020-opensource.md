### Abstract
<p>This talk will provide an overview of the work at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory to re-vamp our open source project offerings,
release processes, and engagements across the Department of Energy and
the US government through efforts such as DOECode and Code.gov. We
will also discuss ongoing work to make it easier for our staff to
engage with open source communities, via both the creation of new
projects and contributions to existing open source projects.  We
believe that these experiences and insights may be useful to a wide
range of developers of high-performance scientific software.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Ian Lee is a Computer Engineer working in the
High Performance Computing (HPC) facility at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL), which is home to some of the largest
supercomputers on the planet. There, he has created a role performing
cyber assessment, penetration testing, and purple teaming duties for
the facility. Ian also has a strong background as a software
developer, with a passion for the use and development of open source
software and practices. His personal mission is to always “leave
things better than you found them.”</p>
