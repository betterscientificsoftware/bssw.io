# 2022 Collegeville Workshop on Scientific Software: Software Design

- Event Dates: Canceled
- Location: St. John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota and online
- Event Website: https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/

<!-- deck starts -->
Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software is intended to bring together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry, and laboratories. While there are certainly existing exchanges between these communities, we are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions and career paths that span these communities.

### Workshop Goals

*UPDATE* The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software from academia, industry and labs for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction for improving the design of scientific software. We want to explore, characterize and articulate scientific software practices from industry, research labs and academia and identify common requirements and essential differences in these communities.

We believe this workshop to be distinct in its efforts to bring academic, industry and lab community members to explore both the common and unique challenges of these communities.

The first day will focus on definitions and challenges; the second day on technical strategies for improvement; the third on cultural approaches for improvement.

Artifacts from the workshop will include submitted white papers, recorded presentations, live panels and discussions, recordings of live sessions and blog articles from selected workshop contributions. We hope these artifacts will advance community progress for scientific software, especially toward better usability across industry, lab and academic institutions. We anticipate that the diverse experience of the workshop attendees will lead to a deeper awareness and understanding of how the represented communities can benefit from collaboration, coordination and complementarity.

### Contribute to Collegeville 2022

Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving scientific software design is encouraged to submit content to build the program of Collegeville 2022.

While we welcome any relevant contribution to the software design theme,

*We are particularly interested in contributions that draw from software design experiences, no matter how formal or informal your design processes are. Often the structures and dynamics of scientific software design are not clearly documented. We also are interested in design approaches that address the software ecosystem, in addition to those that address specific software products. We strongly encourage participants to reflect on how their design processes are organized and operate, and submit content for the workshop in any of the formats listed below. By sharing your design experience, you will help build community awareness about how we can understand and improve scientific software design.*

We also enthusiastically welcome contributions on conceptual models that can help attendees better understand how software design can be improved.

The following contributions are welcome. For details, see <https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/Contribute.html>

| Contribution| Submission Date |
|-------------|-----------------|
| White papers | June 24 | 
| Recorded presentations | June 24 - July 15 | 
| Teatime themes | July 15 |
| Posters     |July 15  |

### Workshop Schedule

The workshop will begin with an informal gathering on the evening of July 25.  The workshop itself will take place July 26-28.  Participants are encourage to plan their departures for July 29.

**UPDATE (Jun 16, 2022): The 2022 Collegeville Workshop has been canceled for the 2022 year**
