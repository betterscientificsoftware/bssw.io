The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) 2022 Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days will take place Tuesday, May 10 – Thursday, May 12, with six to eight sessions per day, similar to the 2021 event. 

The 2022 Community BOF Days will provide an opportunity for the high-performance computing community to engage with ECP teams to discuss our latest development efforts. 
Each BOF will be a 60- to 90-minute session on a given topic, with a brief overview, followed by Q&A. 
The BOFs will be conducted via Zoom.

This year's BOFs, listed below, will include general topics focusing on software sustainability and productivity, approaches to software quality assurance, and a range of subjects related to ECP projects and acivities.
Please see [ECP BOF website](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/ecp-community-bof-days-2022/) for details, including registration.
(Participation is open and free, but registration is required.)
