### Abstract
Spack is an open-source package manager for HPC. Its simple, templated Python DSL allows the same package to be built in many configurations, with different compilers, flags, dependencies, and dependency versions. Spack allows HPC end users to automatically build any of over 3,000 community-maintained packages, software developers to easily manage large applications with hundreds of dependencies, and HPC facility administrators to deploy software stacks for all of their users.

This talk will give a technical overview of Spack, as well as a brief rundown of recent developments, the longer-term Spack road map, and activities within the U.S. Exascale Computing Project (ECP).
