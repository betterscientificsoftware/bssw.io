We are a team of software engineering researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology and Sandia National Laboratories. This survey is part of a study on mentorship practices among people who develop software.

Mentorship is a process in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person (a mentor) helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person (a mentee). Relatively little is known about the practice of mentorship within software development contexts. For that reason, we would like to ask you a few questions about what mentorship means to you and what matters most in mentoring relationships.

The survey is expected to take 10-15 minutes to complete. Only the researchers involved in this study will see your responses. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You also do not have to answer any question that makes you uncomfortable. Participants must be 18+. For questions or comments about the survey, please reach out to Dr. Reed Milewicz (rmilewi@sandia.gov) or Dr. Alexander Serebrenik (a.serebrenik@tue.nl). Clicking submit indicates that you consent to the use of your survey response data in our study.

For every survey completed, we pledge to donate $1 USD to an open-source 501(c)(3) non-profit organization of your choice.
