### Abstract
<p>Software is increasingly important in research, and some of the
scholarly communications community, for example, in FORCE11, has been
pushing the concept of software citations as a method to allow
software developers and maintainers to get academic credit for their
work: software releases are published and assigned DOIs, and software
users then cite these releases when they publish research that uses
the software. This webinar will discuss the state of software
citation, starting with history of work done by the FORCE11 Software
Citation Working Group, leading to a published set of software
citation principles (<a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86">https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86</a>), as well
as other prior work. It will also talk about where the community is
going, what the obstacles to progress are, and how they may be
overcome.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Daniel S. Katz is Assistant Director for
Scientific Software and Applications at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Research Associate Professor in
Computer Science (CS), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and
the School of Information Sciences (iSchool), at the University of
Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research interests include policy
issues, such as citation and credit mechanisms and practices
associated with software and data, organization and community
practices for collaboration, and career paths for computing
researchers. Dan is one of the recipients of the 2018 BSSw
Fellowships. The BSSw Fellowships Program gives recognition and
funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software.</p>
