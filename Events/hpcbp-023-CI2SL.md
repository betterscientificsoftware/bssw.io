### Abstract
<p>This webinar will continue the discussion of open source software
(OSS) opportunities within the scientific ecosystem to include the
many cloud and local services available to OSS free of charge. The
services to be discussed include continuous integration, code
coverage, and static analysis. The presenters will demonstrate the
usefulness of these tools and how a small time investment at the
beginning is traded for long-term benefits. These services and ideas
are agnostic to software language or HPC software application and
should apply to any party interested in tools that help ease the
burden of software maintenance.</p>



### Presenter Bios
<p>Daniel Smith is Software Scientist at the
Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI), whose goal is to serve
as a nexus for science, education, and cooperation serving the
worldwide community of computational molecular scientists – a broad
field including of biomolecular simulation, quantum chemistry, and
materials science.</p>

<p>Daniel has a long history contributing to open-source scientific
projects such as the popular NumPy and Psi4 packages while also
emphasizing educational outreach through Software Carpentry and
MolSSI’s educational activities. His current research interest focuses
on community databases for quantum chemistry that will aid in next
generation molecular force fields, AI research, and novel method
performance assessment.</p>
<p>Ben Pritchard is a Software Scientist at the Molecular
Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI), whose goal is to serve as a
nexus for science, education, and cooperation serving the worldwide
community of computational molecular scientists – a broad field
including of biomolecular simulation, quantum chemistry, and materials
science.</p>

<p>Ben has a background in computational chemistry, receiving his
Ph.D. from the University at Buffalo in 2013. He has a lifelong
passion for computer programming, with current projects relating to
accuracy and precision of computational chemistry calculations. He
also has interests in long-term maintainability and reproducibility in
the computational sciences.</p>
