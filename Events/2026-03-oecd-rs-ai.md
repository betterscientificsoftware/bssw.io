At this hybrid workshop, hosted by the OECD in partnership with EOSC/EVERSE and the Research Software Alliance, stakeholders from academia, government and the private sector will explore policy options to strengthen access to research software as a key enabler of open science. The event will bring together delegates and experts from across the open science ecosystem to review progress, exchange insights, and identify concrete actions.

The workshop forms part of the OECD’s long-standing engagement in open science policy, building on the revised [Recommendation concerning Access to Research Data from Public Funding](https://www.oecd.org/en/toolkits/access-to-research-data-from-public-funding-toolkit.html) adopted in 2021 and the [Declaration on Transformative Science, Technology and Innovation Policies for a Sustainable and Inclusive Future](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0501). It also contributes to the OECD’s 2025-2026 project on achievements and remaining policy gaps in access to research software, aiming to produce a policy paper based on international evidence and case studies. 

## Event objectives and structure

As research software gains recognition as a core research output, the workshop will explore governance, skills, infrastructure, standards, public–private partnerships and international cooperation to inform upcoming OECD work, including discussions at the OECD Committee for Science and Technology Policy (CSTP) meeting in April 2026.

The event will be structured around six thematic sessions:

1. Governance of access to research software: Defining responsibilities and reviewing software policy frameworks.
2. Infrastructure: Stable funding mechanisms beyond project-based grant cycles.
3. Human resources: Recognition, career pathways and credit systems for the research software workforce, including research software engineers (RSEs).
4. Standards and assessment: Development and adoption of technical and procedural standards.
5. Public-private partnerships: How can the private sector support research software in the long term, beyond simple vendor relationships? 
6. International cooperation: Cross-border alignment to support interoperability and long-term sustainability.
