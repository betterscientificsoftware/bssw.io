University of Alabama researchers seek input on testing of research software.

**Description:**  Dr. Jeffrey Carver and Nasir Eisty of the University of Alabama are conducting a research study titled “Testing Research Software”. They wish to assess current practices, identify challenges, and inform the community of potential improvements of **testing techniques and processes** in Research Software development.

Proper testing technique is very important in  Research Software because it has complex computational behavior. This complexity, along with the fact that the expected outputs are often unknown, make it difficult to define appropriate tests and identify input domain boundaries.  In many cases, the input space of research software is so vast, it is not feasible, or even possible,  to develop a test suite that adequately exercises the limits of the software.

Taking part in this study involves completing a 10 minutes web survey about your experience with Research Software testing processes. The results will be available so people will get to know the best practices to improve their current testing infrastructure.

Your participation is completely **anonymous** and **voluntary**.  You are free not to participate or stop participating at any time before you submit your answers. You must be 18 years of age or older to participate in the study and the survey.

This research study has been approved by the University of Alabama Institutional Review Board.

We would greatly appreciate your participation in the survey. Thank you in advance.
