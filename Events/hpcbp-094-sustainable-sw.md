### Abstract

<p>This webinar explores the challenges of stewarding scientific computing software ecosystems and maintaining the longevity of high-performance computing (HPC) software. Using firsthand examples from over five years of experience as maintainer of the Kokkos project, we will discuss key issues that impact software sustainability. The talk will cover managing critical vulnerabilities like the “bus factor,” which highlights the risks of a single point of failure. We’ll also address the “silent drag” of technical debt, which slows development and hinders innovation, and “Hyrum’s Law,” which illustrates how hidden dependencies can break user workflows with every change. By sharing anecdotes and practical strategies for mitigating these risks, this presentation aims to provide valuable insights for developers, maintainers, and project leads working to build a future of sustainable, reliable, and impactful HPC software.</p>
