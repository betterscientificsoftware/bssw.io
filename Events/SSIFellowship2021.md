The Fellowship Programme provides funding for individuals who want to improve how research software is done in their domains and/or area of work. Being a Fellow also helps individuals develop skills and knowledge in their area of software sustainability, empowers them to speak about issues and network with like-minded individuals from a wide variety of research areas.

*To be eligible, applicants must be based in the UK or with a formal affiliation with a UK based institution or office and their plan must be primarily focused on improving UK capability (SSI is a UK funded organisation).*

Each Fellow will be allocated £3,000 to spend over 15 months beginning 1 May 2021. The funding is flexible to support activities that are beneficial to both the Fellow and the Institute. 

Fellows are drawn from a wide range of areas, experience and career stages.
