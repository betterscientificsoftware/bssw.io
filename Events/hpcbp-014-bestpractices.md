### Abstract
<p>How can you introduce best software practices to a long-lived
scientific production code, with a significant user base, that has
“gotten along fine” for years doing things its own way? Often
developers in such projects must struggle with overly complex code,
inadequate documentation, little or no software process, and a “just
write the code fast” culture; these are challenges to software quality
that are generally not issues for new projects. In this presentation
we’ll discuss some of the peculiar problems faced by long-lived
scientific codes, and present a case study of how we’re dealing with
these issues at LANL in the xRage radiation-hydrodynamics simulation
code.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Charles Ferenbaugh is a staff member in the
Applied Computer Science group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He
received a PhD in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1992. Since
2001, he has been a software developer on HPC code projects in LANL&#8217;s
Advanced Simulation and Computing program. Most recently he has led
code refactoring efforts for the Eulerian Applications Project, and
contributed to the Next Generation Code project. He has also been a
part of LANL research efforts in advanced architectures and
programming models.</p>
