### Abstract
<p>How is optimizing HPC applications like an Ant Farm? Attend this
presentation to find out. We’ll discuss the basic concepts around
optimizing code for the HPC systems of today and tomorrow. These
systems require codes to effectively exploit both parallelism between
nodes and an ever growing amount of parallelism on-node. We’ll discuss
profiling strategies, tools (for profiling and debugging) and common
issues with both internode communication and on-node parallelism. We
will give an overview of traditional optimizations areas in HPC
applications like parallel IO and MPI strong and weak scaling as well
as topics relevant for modern GPU and many-core systems like
threading, SIMD/AVX, SIMT and effectively using cache and memory
hierarchies. The “Ant Farm” approach places a heavy emphasis on the
roofline performance model and encouraging users to understand the
compute, bandwidth and latency sensitivity of their applications and
kernels through a series of easy to perform experiments and an easy to
follow flow chart. Finally, we’ll discuss what we expect to change in
the optimization process as we move towards exascale computers.</p>

<!-- Bio provided for webinar 25 -->
<p>Jack Deslippe is the application performance
group lead at NERSC. Jack and his group are partnering with DOE
application teams to evaluate and improve the performance of
applications on Cori and future systems at NERSC. He received a
Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in physics in 2011, with research centered on
computational materials physics and nano-science, including the
development and scaling of electronic-structure codes. Jack has been
at NERSC since 2011, acting as a consultant and developer for
materials science applications and currently leads the NERSC Exascale
Science Applications Program (NESAP).
