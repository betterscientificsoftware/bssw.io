Join us for the next webinar for the National Laboratories Sustainable Scientific Software Conference's new Community of Practice, as Rob Kahler gives us a brief, lighthearted introduction to the concept of Test-Driven Development, including a short example and a discussion of why this specific concept and rigorous testing in general are vital for effective software engineering.

The NLS³C CoP fosters collaboration among individuals interacting with software repositories across the U.S. National Labs complex.
Our mission is to enhance the development culture by promoting best practices, knowledge sharing, and standards that improve quality and sustainability.
We empower developers, project managers, and decision-makers through valuable resources, including monthly webinars.
By cultivating a network of early adopters, we aim to drive culture change and transform the software landscape within the National Labs.
