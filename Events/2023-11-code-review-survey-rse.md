Along with a Ph.D. student, Md Ariful Islam Malik, Jeff Carver of the University of Alabama and Nasir Eisty of Boise State University are conducting a study to understand the practices, impacts, and barriers of code review techniques for research software engineers (RSEs).

The purpose of the study is to understand how RSEs perform code reviews and what challenges they face. Understanding this practice will help members of the community better implement this practice and motivate future study in this area. 

The questions in the survey will focus on your experiences with code review. You are free not to participate or to end the survey at any point.

We are making the responses anonymous, so there is minimal or no risk to participate in this study.

If you would like more information on this study, please contact Dr. Jeffrey Carver (carver@cs.ua.edu) or Dr. Nasir Eisty (nasireisty@boisestate.edu)
