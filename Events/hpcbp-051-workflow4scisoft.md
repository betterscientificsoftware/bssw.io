### Abstract
<p>The webinar will present a workflow that increases the quality of research software in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) by applying established software engineering practices extended with CSE-specific testing and visualization, and periodical cross-linking of software with reports/publications and datasets. The workflow is minimalistic. It introduces a small amount of work overhead, which is crucial for research groups without dedicated funding for ensuring the quality of research software and reproducibility of scientific results.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Tomislav Maric studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, and has obtained his Ph.D. degree at the Institute for Mathematical Modeling and Analysis (MMA), Mathematics Department, at TU Darmstadt (Germany) and is currently working at TU Darmstadt as Athene Young Investigator. Tomislav has been developing unstructured Lagrangian / Eulerian Interface Approximation (LEIA) methods for simulating two-phase flows in the OpenFOAM open-source software since 2008. As a member of the Collaborative Research Center 1194 (CRC) at TU Darmstadt, he supports CRC-1194 researchers in developing research software and data.</p>
