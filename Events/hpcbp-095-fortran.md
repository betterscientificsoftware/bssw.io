This event is a part of the "Best Practices for HPC Software
Developers" webinar series, produced by the [IDEAS Productivity](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
family of projects. The HPC Best Practices webinars address issues faced by
developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on
high-performance computers (HPC) and occur approximately monthly.

### Abstract

<p>Loops are seemingly ubiquitous in programming and yet writing loops provides
one example of a common practice stuck in a pattern as old as high-level
programming languages themselves.  This webinar will provide an overview of the
features introduced in Fortran standards from Fortran 90 to 2023.  We will
venture into often-unvisited nooks and crannies and traverse equally unvisited
expansive pastures.  Weaving feature groups together by the approaches they
enable, the talk will emphasize array, object-oriented, parallel, modular, and
functional programming patterns and paradigms.  The talk will demonstrate the utility
of the described features in open-source packages developed by Berkeley Lab’s
Computer Languages and System Software (CLaSS) Group and our collaborators. The
presentation will emphasize expressiveness and conciseness, showing how our
<a href="https://go.lbl.gov/julienne">Julienne</a> correctness-checking framework supports writing assertions and
unit tests using natural-language idioms; how we write textbook-form partial
differential equations (PDE) in the <a href="https://go.lbl.gov/matcha">Matcha</a> T-cell motility simulator; and
how we concisely capture advanced algorithms for training neural networks in
the <a href="https://go.lbl.gov/fiats">Fiats</a> deep learning library.  The talk will include a brief update on the
status of the compiler and runtime-library support for these features in the
open-source <a href="https://flang.llvm.org">LLVM flang</a> compiler and the <a href="https://go.lbl.gov/caffeine">Caffeine</a> parallel runtime library
developed by CLaSS and our collaborators.  The talk will conclude with a
description of the planned Fortran 2028 support for generic programming via
type-safe templates and the powerful ramifications of this technology in our
development a formally verifiable, domain-specific language embedded in Fortran
2028 via a type system being developed for the <a href="https://github.com/rouson/mole/tree/extended-gauss-divergence/example">MOLE</a> PDE solver library.
One recurring theme will be the ability to write thousands of lines of code
manipulating large collections of data with few or no loops.</p>

### Presenter Bio

<p>Damian Rouson is a Senior Scientist and the Group Lead for the Computer
Languages and Systems Software (CLaSS) Group at Berkeley Lab, where he
researches programming patterns and paradigms for computational science,
He co-develops open-source software, including the <a href="https://go.lbl.gov/caffeine">Caffeine</a> parallel
runtime library, the <a href="https://go.lbl.gov/fiats">Fiats</a> deep learning library, and the <a href="https://go.lbl.gov/julienne">Julienne</a>
correctness-checking framework.  He was the lead author on the book
<em>Scientific Software: The Object-Oriented Way</em> (Cambridge University Press,
2011) and has taught software engineering for science and engineering at
Stanford University and the University of Cyprus and related short
courses at conferences, companies, and government laboratories.  He won a
2021-‘22 Better Scientific Software Fellowship and Berkeley Lab’s 2025
Developer of the Year award. He holds a B.S. from Howard University and
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees Stanford University, all in mechanical engineering.</p>
