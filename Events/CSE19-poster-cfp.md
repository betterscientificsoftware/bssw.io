# Call for Posters: Minisymposterium on Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE and Data Science at SIAM CSE19

- Date: August 23, 2018
- Location: Spokane, WA
- Event Website: https://www.siam.org/conferences/CM/Main/cse19 

We are organizing a minisymposterium (thematic poster group) submission on **Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE and Data Science** (see abstract below) to the [SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.siam.org/conferences/CM/Main/cse19) (CSE19), which will be held during Feb 25 - March 1, 2019 in Spokane, WA. We welcome poster presentation submissions as part of this thematic poster group.  

**Please let us know by Thursday, August 23, 2018** if you are interested in submitting a poster as part of this session. If so, email David Bernholdt <bernholdtde@ornl.gov> with a draft title of your poster and a sentence or two about your area of work.  We will then follow up with instructions for you to submit a poster abstract (1,500 characters maximum) to the CSE19 conference system (and also to us by email); our goal is to collect all abstracts by Friday, August 31.  Unfortunately, SIAM does not provide travel support for poster presenters. If you are also submitting a talk in a minisymposium or contributed session, note that CSE19 conference guidelines allow an individual to present a poster in addition to a talk, provided that the talk and poster are on different results.

All posters in the thematic poster group will be co-located in the poster viewing area, which will provide a rich environment for informal exchange of ideas on software productivity and sustainability issues.   At CSE17, we had a similar minisymposterium including 28 posters, which we subsequently collected and archived on FigShare (<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3703771>).

If you are working on issues in software productivity and sustainability for CSE and data science, please consider submitting a poster to CSE19 as part of this minisymposterium.  We would be glad to address any questions you may have.

Best regards, David (on behalf of Mike, Catherine, Dan, and Lois)

### Minisymposterium: Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE and Data Science

### Organizers:
- David E. Bernholdt (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
- Michael A. Heroux (Sandia National Laboratories)
- Catherine Jones (Science and Technology Facilities Council, UK)
- Daniel S. Katz (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)
- Lois Curfman McInnes (Argonne National Laboratory)

### Abstract:

Software is the key crosscutting technology that enables advances in mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering to achieve robust simulations and analysis for predictive science, engineering, and other research fields.  While software is becoming more complex due to multiphysics and multiscale modeling, the coupling of data analytics, and disruptive changes in computer hardware (due to increases in typical system scale and heterogeneity, including GPUs and additional alternative architectures), software itself has not traditionally received focused attention in the CSE community or been rewarded by that community.  The presenters in this minisymposterium will address work that addresses growing technical and social challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability, and thereby helps software fulfill its critical role as a cornerstone of long-term CSE collaboration. Having a minisymposterium for these topics provides a natural gathering point during poster sessions for informal conversation.
