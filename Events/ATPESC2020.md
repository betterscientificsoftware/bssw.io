# Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC 2020)

- Dates: March 2, 2020
- Location: Chicago area, Illinois, USA
- Event Website: https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/

Doctoral students, postdocs, and computational scientists are encouraged to apply to this intensive two-week course.  The call for applications is open through March 2, 2020. 

**Description:** The Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC) provides intensive, two-week training on the key skills, approaches, and tools to design, implement, and execute computational science and engineering applications on current high-end computing systems and the leadership-class computing systems of the future.  ATPESC will take place July 26 - August 7, 2020. 

The core of the program will focus on programming methodologies that are effective across a variety of supercomputers and that are expected to be applicable to exascale systems. Additional topics to be covered include computer architectures, mathematical models and numerical algorithms, approaches to building community codes for HPC systems, and methodologies and tools relevant for Big Data applications.

The ATPESC program fills the gap that exists in the training computational scientists typically receive through formal education or other shorter courses. With around 65 participants accepted each year, admission to the ATPESC program is highly competitive. ATPESC is part of the Exascale Computing Project, a collaborative effort of the DOE Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration.

**Program Topics**

Renowned scientists and leading HPC experts will serve as lecturers and guide the hands-on sessions. The core curriculum will cover:

* Hardware architectures
* Programming models and languages
* Data-intensive computing and I/O
* Visualization and data analysis
* Numerical algorithms and software for extreme-scale science
* Performance tools and debuggers
* Software productivity and sustainability
* Machine learning and deep learning for science
