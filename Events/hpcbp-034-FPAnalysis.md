### Abstract
<p>Scientific software is central to the practice of research
computing. While software is widely used in many science and
engineering disciplines to simulate real-world phenomena, developing
accurate and reliable scientific software is notoriously
difficult. One of the most serious difficulties comes from dealing
with floating-point arithmetic to perform numerical
computations. Round-off errors occur and accumulate at all levels of
computation, while compiler optimizations and low-precision arithmetic
can significantly affect the final computational results. With
accelerators such as GPUs dominating high-performance computing
systems, computational scientists are faced with even bigger
challenges, given that ensuring numerical reproducibility in these
systems poses a very difficult problem. This webinar provides
highlights from a half-day tutorial discussing tools that are
available today to analyze floating-point scientific software. We
focus on tools that allow programmers to get insight about how
different aspects of floating-point arithmetic affect their code and
how to fix potential bugs.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Ignacio Laguna is a Computer Scientist at the
Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL). His main area of research is
high-performance computing (HPC) and main sub-area of research in HPC
is programing models and systems. He is a 2019 Better Scientific
Software Fellow helping code teams to improve the reliability of
scientific software through analyzing and debugging floating-point
software.</p>
