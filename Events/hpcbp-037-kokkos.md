### Abstract
<p>The Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Ecosystem is a production-level solution for writing modern C++ applications in an hardware-agnostic way. It is part of the US Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project—the leading effort in the US to prepare the HPC community for the next generation of supercomputing platforms. Kokkos is now used by more than a hundred HPC projects, and Kokkos-based codes are running regularly at-scale on at least five of the top ten supercomputers in the world. In this webinar, we will give a short overview of what the Kokkos Ecosystem provides, including its programming model, math kernels library, tools, and training resources, before providing an overview of the Kokkos team’s efforts surrounding the ISO-C++ standard, and how Kokkos both influences future standards and aligns with developments occurring in them. The webinar will include a status update on the progress in supporting the upcoming exascale class HPC systems announced by DOE.</p>



### Presenter Bio
<p>Christian Trott is a high performance computing expert with extensive experience designing and implementing software for modern HPC systems. He is a principal member of staff at Sandia National Laboratories, where he leads the Kokkos core team developing the performance portability programming model for C++ and heads Sandia’s delegation to the ISO C++ standards committee. He also serves as adviser to numerous application teams, helping them redesign their codes using Kokkos and achieve performance portability for the next generation of supercomputers. Christian is a regular contributor to numerous scientific software projects including LAMMPS and Trilinos. He earned a doctorate from the University of Technology Ilmenau in theoretical physics with a focus on computational material research.</p>
