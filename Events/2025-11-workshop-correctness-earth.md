### Summary
The second annual Workshop on Correctness and Reproducibility for Earth System Software will take place from November 5–7, 2025, at the Mesa Laboratory of the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado.
This workshop aims to provide  a dedicated forum for earth system modelers, research software engineers, and the broader scientific software community to discuss challenges, opportunities, and recent advances in ensuring software correctness and reproducibility.

Sponsored by the [2025 Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship program](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program), this year’s workshop will feature a *Tutorial on Rigor and Reasoning in Research Software (R3Sw)*, which will include sessions on practical 
techniques for improving software quality and reliability in scientific computing. 
The tutorial will cover core topics such as unit testing, continuous integration (CI), property-based testing, correctness in AI, and reasoning in research software.

### Call for Abstracts

Contributions from researchers, software engineers, and practitioners in the Earth System Modeling community, as well as the broader scientific computing community, are invited. Topics include:

 - Testing, debugging, QA, and CI tools
 - Statistical and ensemble-based validation
 - Software design for correctness and reproducibility
 - Automated reasoning, formal methods, and verification techniques
 - Validation of HPC, cloud, heterogeneous, and GPU-based applications
 - Other verification and validation approaches.

Relevant applications include earth system modeling software, external libraries, AI techniques, diagnostics, packaging, and development practices.
