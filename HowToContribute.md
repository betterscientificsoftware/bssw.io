### How to Contribute Content to Better Scientific Software

#### Background
[The repository https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) is a specially-designated repository according to GitHub organizational policy.  The contents of this repository are automatically rendered as a website with the URL: [https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/).  For example [this file (HowToContribute.md)](HowToContribute.md) is automatically rendered at the URL [https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/HowToContribute.html](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/HowToContribute.html)

Any `.md` file written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) is automatically visible via its pre-defined URL.  Given the ease of content development using GitHub's online content capabilities, the ability to work with the website as a GitHub repository, and the possibility to create scripting tools that can extract, create and test content in this repository, we encourage contributors to the BSSW project to use the following processes.

#### Alternative: Clone/Fork repository locally  
1. Clone (if you are a BSSW member) or [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.
2. Create a new .md file in your local repository, or edit an existing file.
3. [Add](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) the file to the repo (if new) or commit the updated file to your local repository.
4. Push the change, or create a pull request, to send the file to the main GitHub repository
5. If you submitted a pull request, it will be reviewed by BSSW team members for inclusion in the repository.
**Note: If you are not familiar with GitHub workflows, there are many tutorials to help.**
