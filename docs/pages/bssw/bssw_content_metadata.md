## Introduction

We include metadata as *formatted comments* at the end of the file.  Metadata helps define rules about publishing an article, selecting categories etc. Metadata information is internally parsed by the BSSw.io website and used for operational and functional purposes. This metadata is not visible on the website.  If metadata is missing, the file will not be published/visible on the website. Missing metadata will not cause the website to break. But be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSSw front-end site. 

## Metadata format and examples

Listed here is the format of a typical metadata.

```
<!---
Publish: yes
Pinned: no
Track: deep dive
Topics: software engineering, testing
RSS update: 2020-12-17
--->
```

Please note above:
* "Publish", "Topics" and "Track" are the minimal metadata that is required. "Pinned" and "RSS update" are optional, as their usage is limited, but its recommended you use it.
* The use of `<!--- --->` surrounding the metadata.
  * **Note:** This is an XML comment **with an extra dash**.
    **Three** dashes are required for the metadata block to be recognized.
* Each metadata parameter is on a separate line.
* Please follow the rules of use colon and commas as specified above. Letter case does not matter.
* Metadata values can be specified with or without quotes

The easiest approach to writing metadata is to copy/paste the formatted example and modify it, as needed. Alternatively, copy the metadata from any of the content files ([curated content](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/main/CuratedContent), [events](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/main/Events) and [articles](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/main/Articles)) in the BSSw.io repository, modify and use them in your content file.

## Metadata description

Following is the set of metadata parameters used on the BSSw.io, currently.

### Publish
This is used to decide if the content needs to be published or not on the BSSw front-end site. 
````
Publish: yes

Publish: no
````
Only files designated as 'publish: yes' (and merged in the main branch) will be published on the front-end BSSw site. 
Work that has not been finalized or is not intended for the front-end site should be designated 'publish: no'. 

Please note that BSSw.io has a stand-alone website for previewing content before publishing. To view data on preview site, please use the "preview" label in the pull request of that item and rebuild the preview site. For previewing purposes, the 'publish' metadata is ignored and only the preview label is considered.


### Pinned
This is used to decide if a content needs to show up as "recommended", when a particular category or topic is selected. Recommended articles will show up on the top of the list of articles. For every category and topic, there is a "What is" file that explains the name of that category/topic. These "What Is" files have 'Pinned: yes'. The intention is that these files show up on the top of the list (when a category or topic is clicked on) so that readers can understand what that category/topic means.

````
Pinned: yes

Pinned: no
````

### Track
The 'track' metadata is applicable only to content in the blogs folder. They are ignored for curated content and events. Articles in the blogs folder can be assigned one track from the following tracks. Authors are encouraged to choose a track that they feel best suits their article. **The BSSw editorial team may add/revise tracks, as needed, over time.**

````
Track: deep dive
````

The current tracks are as follows:
- **deep dive**: for articles that examine the intricacies and finer details of the discussed topics, with an attempt to provide an deeper exploration to enhance understanding.
- **experience**: offers articles offering firsthand accounts and practical insights from practitioners, shedding light on real-world software, challenges, and successes. 
- **community**: presents articles that highlight collaborative endeavors, emphasizing community-driven initiatives and efforts aimed at empowering the scientific computing community.
- **how to**: offers practical resources to foster a deeper understanding and facilitate the potential implementation of various topics in software productivity, quality, and sustainability.
- **bright spots**:  illuminates notable achievements and advancements in a particular topic, showcasing success stories and innovations that stand out
- **bssw fellowship**: presents articles related to the BSSw fellowship.

### Topics

Topics are visible filters displayed on the BSSw website interface that provide readers with easier navigation and content searching abilities. A family of topics that make sense together are grouped together in a category. There are around 4-7 topics per category. **The BSSw editorial team may add/revise topics, as needed, over time.**

````
Topics: software engineering, testing
````

The current topics are as follows:

- **Planning** category has the following topics:
    - Software process improvement
    - Software engineering
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Software interoperability
    - Software sustainability
- **Development** category has the following topics:
    - Documentation
    - Configuration and builds

    - Refactoring
- **Performance** category has the following topics:
    - High-performance computing (HPC)
    - Performance at leadership computing facilities (LCFs)
    - Performance portability
    - Cloud computing
    - Big data
- **Reliability** category has the following topics:
    - Peer code review

    - Software publishing and citation
    - Licensing
    - Discussion and question sites
    - Conferences and workshops
    - Research Software Engineers
- **Skills** category has the following topics:
    - Online learning
    - In-Person learning
    - Personal productivity and sustainability
    
### RSS update
This is used to set the date for RSS update in format yyyy-mm-dd.

The BSSw.io site automatically generates an RSS feed. Currently, it is capped at the 10 most recent items (we can change this with help of our frontend partners, should we need to). The rule is to use the newer of the Publication Date (within the article) or the RSS Date (in the article metadata).

Please note that if you edit an article and don't change the Publication Date or the RSS Date, the RSS feed will not change. This what you'd typically want to do for minor updates, corrections, etc.

If you want the article to reappear in the RSS feed, as if it were newly published, set the RSS Date metadata tag to the current date (or an appropriate near-future date).

````
RSS update: 2020-12-17
````

## Deprecated metadata

Listed below are metadata that were created for various feature-related experiments, but **are NOT IN USE** currently.

**Tags**

Tags were optional additional keywords for searches. 


**Categories**

Categories were displayed on BSSw.io to provide easier navigation. Each article could belong to one or more categories. Categories have been replaced by the "topic" tag in metadata. 

The categories were defined as follows:
- Planning
- Development
- Performance
- Reliability
- Collaboration
- Skills

**Level**

The *level* metadata was used to specify level of detail and depth of content.
- **Level 0**:  BSSw WhatIs document
- **Level 1**:  BSSw HowTo document (or equivalent level of detail)
- **Level 2**:  More detailed content, beginner or intermediate levels
- **Level 3**:  Advanced content

**Prerequisites**

This option was used to specify files for any assumed knowledge on the BSSw site.
- Most prerequisites are specified automatically according to Topics. In this case, use:
   - Prerequisites: default
- Specify additional prerequisites only for information not already covered by Topics.
   - Prerequisites: filename1.md, filename2.md, etc.

**Aggregate**

This was optional info used for aggregating content to define a more complex resource.
 - Aggregate: none
   - Note an aggregate resource

 - Aggregate: base
   - The "base" designation of an aggregate resource indicates that content and metadata will be included from subresource files, as specified in a bulleted list of subresources.  See the file [CuratedContent/ResourceTemplate.AggregateBase.md](CuratedContent/ResourceTemplate.AggregateBase.md) for an example "base" file that demonstrates how to specify subresources.

- Aggregate: subresource
  - The "subresource" specification indicates that the item will not be displayed as a separate resource on the front-end BSSw site.  We expect this to be the most common usage.  

- Aggregate: stand-alone and subresource
   - The "stand-alone and subresource" specification indicates that the item will be both (1) listed as a separate resource on the front-end site and (2) used as a subresource, as specified by an aggregate "base" resource.
