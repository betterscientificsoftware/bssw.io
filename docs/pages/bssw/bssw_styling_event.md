## Introduction

An "Event" content is a very brief article that highlights an event. An event article can highlight the following 2 types of resources: (1) workshops/conferences/deadline/submisison-based events, (2) tutorials/panels/no-submission based events.

The main part of the event article consists of the (1) Deck, (2) Main body of the article and (3) Metadata. The following sections describe the structure and various parts of an event article.

A written event content article must follow the below style guidelines. There are several examples available in the [betterscientificsoftware.github.io repository](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/tree/master/events) to use as a starting point.


## Deck Section
As we know, all BSSw.io resources have decks and the deck has two parts: (1) deck text and (2) deck attributes. Following is guidance for "Events" and their decks.

### Deck text
Deck text is usually a couple of lines about the event. No images are allowed in the event deck. For all other guidance on the deck text, please see [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

### Deck Attributes

**Mandatory deck attributes** that are part of deck for all BSSw.io content. Guidance, specific for "Events" for these common mandatory deck attributes is given below.

1. **Deck title**: This is the title of the event. In addition to guidelines from the [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide, please also note the following:
	* Please keep the title timeline-neutral. That means: do not include words like "Call for submissions" etc in the title. The reason being is that this BSSw.io event may get updated with archives, videos at a later point. As of July 2020, the titles form a part of the URL and we do not want the URL to change over time.
	* Title can include full event name as well as abbreviation in brackets:  *Example*: `The Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2020)`

2. **Contributor name**: In addition to guidelines from the [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide, please also note the following:
* Please indicate the *name of the person* who has submitted this event for inclusion on the BSSw site. This should not be the person who is adding the event to the BSSw.io site but rather the person who submitted the event. If you have no contributor name, then use "BSSw.io team". 
	* *Example*: `#### Contributed by BSSw.io team`

3. **Publication date**, **BSSw Categories**, **BSSw Topics**: There is no specific guidance for these for the event content type. See [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

**Special deck attributes** are seen right below the deck text. There are four deck attributes specific to events and are listed below. These event deck attributes customize different parts of the deck for the event content type.

1. **Date**: Date or range of dates when the EVENT is taking place
2. **Location**: Use the word "Virtual" or name of physical location
3. **Event Website**: URL to the main event website
4. **Organizers**:  Name of the organizers (This field is usually used for webinars/tutorials/panels (and not for conferences/workshops))

*Example:*
- `Date: November 16, 2020`
- `Location: Online`
- `Event Website: https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2020`

## Main Body Section
### General Guidelines
1. In the body of the event, first level headings should start with `### ` heading format.
2. Please write the body text in "third person" even if you are copy-pasting it from somewhere. The BSSw.io team is not an organizer of most of these events, hence usage of third-person grammar is essential.
3. If you do not plan to update the event in the future, refrain from adding text such as "TBD", "Coming soon". In such cases, please rephrase text to point to links where such information may be updated by the third-parties.
4. Please add "The *current* deadline is ...." and "Please see event website for deadline updates" to your text where relevant. The BSSw.io site cannot track and keep updating new deadlines to the event. Use this kind of discretion for the text when you write.
5. As far as you can,  please point people to the main event website (and not to specific pages and links). Specific pages can change over time and cause broken links.
6. Avoid copying ALL details from the event website. Event websites have a lot of specific details which we don't have to provide on the BSSw.io website.

### Structure of the main body
The usual sections of the body text for  *upcoming events* has three parts: (1) Short introduction, (2) Event table and (3) Additional information.

#### 1.  Main body introduction
This is text without any heading introducing the event.

#### 2. Event table declaration
This table exists to highlight important information about the event such as event date, deadlines, website, registration, archives. Given below is guidance for two types of tables: (1) conference/workshops/similar events, (2) webinars/tutorials/similar events. Most of the BSSw.io event content can be covered by these two tables. Major difference between in the tables: for deadline-based events, we add submission deadline information in the table and for events such as webinars, we add presenter details.

#### 3. Additional Information
You can add additional information here. If you create sections, please remember to start your first level headings with `###`. Below is guidance for two types of events: (1) conference/workshops/similar events, (2) webinars/tutorials/similar events.

##### Conferences/Workshops
Usually the following information is added, but depending on the nature of the event, more information can be added
* `### Description` : Description of the workshop
* `### Program Topics`:  Topics covered in the workshop

##### Webinars/Panels/Tutorials
Usually the following information is added and is usually sufficient
* `### Abstract` : A section with the abstract of the talk to be presented
* `### Author Bios`: A section with the author bios

## Metadata Section
There is no specific guidance for this for the event content type. See [common layout section](CommonLayout.md) of the guide.

## Updating Past events
Past events may be updated with information pointing to where the presentation, recording archives have been stored. In such updates, you can add rows to the table above or modify the information as needed.

<!--
## QUESTIONS
1. When we add archive information, do we want to state "UPDATED: With presentations, pdf etc etc.", right on the top of the page below the deck? Or is that not needed?
