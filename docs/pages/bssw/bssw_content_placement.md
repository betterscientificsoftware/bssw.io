## Where to place your content-related files in Github repo?
Please place your new file in one of the following folders on the site, according to the type of content you are creating:

- [CuratedContent](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/master/CuratedContent): For any curated content and  HowTo documents.
- [Events](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/master/Events): For any events.
- [Articles/WhatIs](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/master/Articles/WhatIs): For WhatIs articles.
- [Articles/Blog](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/master/Articles/Blog): For Blogs
- [Articles/ShortArticles](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io/tree/master/Articles/ShortArticles): For any other original contents; other than blogs and WhatIs documents.


Please note that images, including logos and deck images are stored
in a different independent repository, located [here](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images). We hope to eventually
move these to the main bssw.io repository
