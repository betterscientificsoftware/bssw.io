We expect all contributors to the Better Scientific Software site to follow this
Contributor Code of Conduct. All contributors agree to abide by these terms.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering
an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project an inclusive experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion,
or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to edit, remove or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not consistent with this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of
Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently
applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project
maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be removed
from the project.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
