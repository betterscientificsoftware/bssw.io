## Introduction

All GitHub file names for BSSw.io articles should follow the naming conventions laid out [here](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/bssw.io/bssw_file_naming.html).

All BSSw.io resources have the following three sections, in common: 
- Deck
- Main body
- Metadata. 

The following image shows the deck and main body of a resource. Metadata section is not seen on the main site.

Following is a description of the common elements.

## Deck Section
The deck is the top shaded portion of the article. The elements of the deck are mostly the same across all the BSSw.io content types but with a few variations. The deck has two parts: (1) deck text/image and (2) deck attributes.

### Deck Text/Image
Most content types will have  the deck text, which is usually couple of lines highlighting the article. For curated content and events, deck text contains a two-sentence descriptive text about the resource. Some content types, such as original content, may have a deck image instead of the deck text, as described in the [original article styling](bssw_styling_originalarticles.html) section.

Following is some general guidance for deck text:
- Please add comments around deck text in the source file, as shown below: 
````
<!-- deck text start --> 
This is deck text 
<!-- deck text end -->
````
- No hyperlinks are allowed in the deck.
- If text is used, then the deck contains one or atmost two sentences about the article which piques user interest.
- Whenever resource is mentioned in deck or body text in verbatim, it needs to be italicized.

### Deck Attributes
The deck section, of every content type, will *always* contain the following *mandatory deck attributes*. These mandatory deck attributes may have some specific guidelines for the different content types, and these guidelines can be found in the styling guides for that particular content type. In general, the mandatory deck attributes are: (1) title of the article, (2) author/contributor/organizer names, and (3) BSSw.io topics that the article falls under. 

However, the different content types may have additional *content-specific deck attributes* as well. Please refer to the styling guides for each content type for these content-specific deck attributes.

#### Deck Title
A deck title should be simple and straighforward.
* The title of the article also becomes a portion of the article URL (as of Apr 2020); hence changing the title after publishing it is strictly discouraged.
* Conjuctions and Prepositions, used in the title, should be lowercase. Every other word should be sentence-case.

#### Contributor Name
This is name of the contributor/author/organizer. This contains the full name of the contributor and a URL, usually to the github profile, of the contributor. In the source file, please use the following format: 
````
#### Contributed by [Firstname Lastname](github profile url "Firstname Lastname")
````

#### BSSw Topics
These indicate which BSSw.io topic areas the article belongs to. The most up-to-date topic areas can be obtained from the BSSw.io website (click Resources link at https://bssw.io/ to find the list of topics). In the source file, the topics for the article can be indicated in the *[metadata section](bssw_content_metadata.html#categories)* of the article. 

## Main Body Section
The main body is the portion of the article below the deck. BSSw.io uses [Github-Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for writing content. The elements of the main body differ based on content type. The main body should explain the content from the perspective of the CSE community. There may be image file (e.g., logo, relevant diagram, science image) in the body text, although these are optional (but encouraged when this exists). Please read *styling rules* for individual types of content.

## Handling images
Images for content are stored in a different repository (and not the main repo). To reference the images in the article, we upload them [bssw.io images directory](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images) and then reference them from the article.
- Add the following url. Using the "logo" class helps constrain the size of the image.
````
< img src='<img src='https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/images/raw/master/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME.png' class='logo' />
````
- Please ensure we have permission to use the logo/image 
- Please ensure logo is clear and high resolution

## Links and References
Very rarely, but possibly, we may have references/citations at the end of the article. There is an in-progress process for this. Please contact the Editor-in-chief for more information on this. 

## Metadata Section
We include metadata as *formatted comments* at the end of the file.  Metadata helps define rules about publishing an article, tagging them, selecting topics, etc. Be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSSw front-end site. Please read the [common metadata section](bssw_content_metadata.html) to get detailed insight on the different metadata parameters and their importance.

## Unpublishing Content
Please follow the below rules
1. There needs to be  documentation about why content is being unpublished. On top of the content file, please add

 ````
 Date1: mm-dd-yyyy: Reason for unpublishing
 Date2: mm-dd-yyyy: Reason for unpublishing
 ````
 
2. Add the word UNPUB to file file name. For example: `GitversionUNPUB.md`


{% include links.html %}
