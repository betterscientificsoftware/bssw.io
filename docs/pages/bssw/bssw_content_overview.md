There are three types of authored content on BSSw.io. See a very short description below and refer to the ["BSSw.io - What to Contribute"](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software) page for detailed information.

## Original articles (also called Blogs)

Blogs are articles containing original content, often reflecting the author's experiences. They are crafted to inform the CSE community on enhancing aspects of software productivity and sustainability. Alternatively, blogs may delve deeply into a specific topic or cater to the community by covering areas of interest. Brevity is valued; typically, a blog ranges from 500 to 1,500 words. We actively seek contributions from thought leaders within the community and welcome proposals from anyone.

## Curated content 

Brief article that highlights other web-based content (such as tools, websites, books, organizations, etc.). Your article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content.


## Events

Brief description of an event (such as a workshop, conference, or tutorial) relevant to better scientific software.


## What-Is articles

In addition to the original articles, curated content, and events, we feature *What-Is* articles on BSSw.io. These articles are particularly relevant to the BSSw.io editorial team, and although not explicitly mentioned on the BSSw.io site, they play a crucial role. Whenever a new topic is added to BSSw.io, a short *What-Is* article is created to introduce the meaning and applicability of that topic in scientific computing. These articles appear as *Recommended* when browsing a topic's resource list. To designate an article as *Recommended*, utilize the *Pinned* metadata (refer to the meta-data section for details on *Pinned*). For example, while exploring the *[documentation](https://bssw.io/items?topic=documentation)* topic topic, readers can find recommended articles conveniently placed at the top of the resource listing.
