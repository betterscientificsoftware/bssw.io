## Naming your files in Github repo

This section describes how to name the `.md` (markdown) file that is put in Github for ANY type of content/resource. 

* Please name your markdown file according to the following convention:
  ```
  YYYY-MM-DocTitleInCamelCase.md
  ```
  where
    * YYYY = four digit year
    * MM = two digit month. 
* If the content is of type Curated Content or a Blog do not include the date part.
* For the `DocTitle...` part of the file name, to avoid terribly long file names,
authors are encouraged to use appropriate abbreviations and/or truncation. The point
is to capture the content's topic as clearly as possible in the file name without getting
too unwieldy in the length of name. But authors should be sure to capture at least the
first *distinguishing* word of the title in the `DocTitle...` part of the file name.
