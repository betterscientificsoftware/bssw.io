**Original theme**
This jekyll style is inspired from
* https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll
* https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/

**Pending items:**
1. Deleting the extra files that are present from the original theme that are not going to be used. 
2. The only way to get the github “edit me” links working on the gh-pages was with putting settings such as the one mentioned in _config.yml for the repository parameter.
3. Organize the contents in pages/bssw better?
4. search button: does it serve a purpose?
5. pdf options: do they serve a purpose?
6. tag options: do they serve a purpose?
7. Should we keep features (provided by the theme) that we are not using currently?
